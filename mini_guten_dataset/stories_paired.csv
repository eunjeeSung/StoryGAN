Tom soon got rested at his mother's house, but could not       travel because it had rained; his mother therefore took him       in her hand and carried him back to King Arthur's court.       There Tom entertained the King and Queen and nobility at       tilts and tournaments, at which he exerted himself so much       that he brought on a fit of sickness. At this juncture the       Queen of the Fairies came in a chariot drawn by flying mice,       and placing Tom by her side she drove through the air till       they arrived at her palace. After restoring him to health,       the Queen commanded a fair wind, and, placing Tom before it,       blew him straight back to the court of King Arthur. But just       as Tom should have alighted in the courtyard, the cook       happened to pass with the King's great bowl of his favorite       dish, furmenty, and poor Tom fell plump into the middle of       it, and splashed the hot furmenty into the cook's eyes. Down       went the bowl. ""Oh, dear,"" cried Tom. ""Murder! murder!""       bellowed the cook; and away ran the King's nice furmenty into       the kennel. The cook was a cross fellow and swore to the King       that Tom had done it out of some evil design; so he was tried       for high treason and sentenced to be beheaded. When the judge       delivered this dreadful sentence it happened that a miller       was standing by with his mouth wide open, so Tom took a good       spring and jumped down his throat, unperceived by all, even       by the miller himself. As Tom could not be found the court       broke up, and away went the miller to his mill. But Tom did       not leave him long at rest, he began to roll and tumble       about, so that the miller thought himself bewitched, and sent       for a doctor. When the doctor came, Tom began to dance and       sing. The doctor was as much frightened as the miller, and       sent in great haste for five more doctors.     ",11092_3.jpg

37,1,37_1.jpg,"ERY many years ago, instead of having servants to wait upon them and work for them, people used to have slaves. These slaves were paid no wages. Their masters gave them only food and clothes in return for their work.When any one wanted servants he went to market to buy them, just as nowadays we buy horses and cows, or even tables and chairs.If the poor slaves were bought by kind people they would be quite happy. Then they would work willingly for their masters and mistresses, and even love them. But very often cruel people bought slaves. These cruel people used to beat them and be unkind to them in many other ways.It was very wicked to buy and sell human beings as if they were cattle. Yet Christian people did it, and many who were good and kind otherwise thought there was no wrong in being cruel to their poor slaves. 'They are only black people,' they said to themselves. 'Black people do not feel things as we do.' That was not kind, as black people suffer pain just in the same way as white people do.One of the saddest things for the poor slaves was that they could never long be a happy family all together—father, mother, and little brothers and sisters—because at any time the master might sell the father or the mother or one of the children to some one else. When this happened those who were left behind were very sad indeed—more sad than if their dear one had died.Uncle Tom was a slave. He was a very faithful and honest servant, and his master, Mr. Shelby, was kind to him. Uncle Tom's wife was called Aunt Chloe. She was Mr. Shelby's head cook, and a very good one too, she was. Nobody in all the country round could make such delicious pies and cakes as Aunt Chloe.Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe lived together in a pretty little cottage built of wood, quite close to Mr. Shelby's big house.The little cottage was covered with climbing roses, and the garden was full of beautiful bright flowers and lovely fruit trees.",11171_1.jpg
37,2,37_2.jpg,"As soon as Mr. and Mrs. Shelby stopped talking, Eliza crept away to her own room, where little Harry was sleeping. There he lay with his pretty curls around his face. His rosy mouth was half open, his fat little hands thrown out over the bed-clothes, and a smile like a sunbeam upon his face.'My baby, my sweet-one,' said Eliza, 'they have sold you. But mother will save you yet!'She did not cry. She was too sad and sorrowful for that. Taking a piece of paper and a pencil, she wrote quickly.'Oh, missis! dear missis! don't think me ungrateful—don't think hard of me, anyway! I heard all you and master said to-night. I am going to try to save my boy—you will not blame me I God bless and reward you for all your kindness!'Eliza was going to run away.She gathered a few of Harry's clothes into a bundle, put on her hat and jacket, and went to wake him.Poor Harry was rather frightened at being waked in the middle of the night, and at seeing his mother bending over him, with her hat and jacket on.'What is the matter, mother?' he said beginning to cry.",11171_2.jpg
37,3,37_3.jpg,"It was a beautiful, clear, starlight night, but very cold, for it was winter-time. Eliza ran quickly to Uncle Tom's cottage, and tapped on the window.Aunt Chloe was not asleep, so she jumped up at once, and opened the door. She was very much astonished to see Eliza standing there with Harry in her arms. Uncle Tom followed her to the door, and was very much astonished too.'I'm running away, Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe—carrying off my child,' said Eliza. 'Master sold him.''Sold him?' they both echoed, lifting up their hands in dismay.'Yes, sold him,' said Eliza. 'I heard master tell missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom. The man is coming to take you away to-morrow.'",11171_3.jpg
38,0,38_0.jpg,"At first Tom could hardly believe what he heard. Then he sank down, and buried his face in his hands.'The good Lord have pity on us!' said Aunt Chloe. 'What has Tom done that master should sell him?''He hasn't done anything—it isn't for that. Master don't want to sell; but he owes this man money. If he doesn't pay him it will end in his having to sell the house and all the slaves. Master said he was sorry. But missis she talked like an angel. I'm a wicked girl to leave her so, but I can't help it. It must be right; but if it an't right, the good Lord will forgive me, for I can't help doing it.'Tom,' said Aunt Chloe, 'why don't you go too? There's time.'Tom slowly raised his head and looked sorrowfully at her.'No, no,' he said. 'Let Eliza go. It is right that she should try to save her boy. Mas'r has always trusted me, and I can't leave him like that. It is better for me to go alone than for the whole place to be sold. Mas'r isn't to blame, Chloe. He will take care of you and the poor—'Tom could say no more. Big man though he was, he burst into tears, at the thought of leaving his wife and dear little children, never to see them any more.'Aunt Chloe,' said Eliza, in a minute or two, 'I must go. I saw my husband to-day. He told me he meant to run away soon, because his master is so cruel to him. Try to send him a message from me. Tell him I have run away to save our boy. Tell him to come after me if he can. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless you!'",11171_4.jpg
38,1,38_1.jpg,"Eliza walked on and on, never resting, all through the night. When the sun rose, she was many miles away from her old home. Still she walked on, only stopping, in the middle of the day, to buy a little dinner for herself and Harry at a farm-house.At last, when it was nearly dark, she arrived at a village, on the banks of the river Ohio. If she could only get across that river, Eliza felt she would be safe.",11171_5.jpg
38,2,38_2.jpg,"She went to a little inn on the bank, where a kind-looking woman was busy cooking supper.'Is there a boat that takes people across the river now?' she asked.'No, indeed,' replied the woman. 'The boats has stopped running. It isn't safe, there be too many blocks of ice floating about.'Eliza looked so sad and disappointed when she heard this, that the good woman was sorry for her. Harry too was so tired, that he began to cry.'Here, take him into this room,' said the woman, opening the door into a small bed-room.Eliza laid her tired little boy upon the bed, and he soon fell fast asleep. But for her there was no rest. She stood at the window, watching the river with its great floating blocks of ice, wondering how she could cross it.As she stood there she heard a shout. Looking up she saw Sam. She drew back just in time, for Haley and Andy were riding only a yard or two behind him.It was a dreadful moment for Eliza. Her room opened by a side door to the river. She seized her child and sprang down the steps towards it.",11171_6.jpg
38,3,38_3.jpg,"ELIZA FINDS A REFUGEA lady and gentleman were sitting talking happily together in the drawing-room of the white house to which Eliza had gone. Suddenly their old black man-of-all-work put his head in at the door and said, 'Will missis come into the kitchen?'The lady went. Presently she called to her husband, 'I do wish you would come here a moment.'He rose and went into the kitchen.There lay Eliza on two kitchen chairs. Her poor feet were all cut and bleeding, and she had fainted quite away. The master of the house drew his breath short, and stood silent.His wife and the cook were trying to bring Eliza round. The old man had Harry on his knee, and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings, to warm the little cold feet.'Poor creature,' said the lady.Suddenly Eliza opened her eyes. A dreadful look of pain came into her face. She sprang up saying, 'Oh, my Harry, have they got him?'",11171_7.jpg
39,0,39_0.jpg,"It was such a sad story, that the tears came into the eyes of everyone who heard her tell it.'Where do you mean to go to, poor woman?' asked the lady.'To Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is Canada'? said Eliza, looking up in a simple, trusting way, to the kind lady's face.'Poor woman,' said she again.'Is it a great way off?' asked Eliza.'Yes,' said the lady of the house sadly, 'it is far away. But we will try to help you to get there.' Eliza wanted to go to Canada, because it belonged to the British. They did not allow any one to be made a slave there. George, too, was going to try to reach Canada.'Wife,' said the gentleman, when they had gone back again into their own sitting-room, 'we must get that poor woman away to-night. She is not safe here. I know some good people, far in the country, who will take care of her.'So this kind gentleman got the carriage ready, and drove Eliza and her boy a long, long way, through the dark night, to a cottage far in the country. There he left her with a good man and his wife, who promised to be kind to her, and help her to go to Canada. He gave some money to the good man too, and told him to use it for Eliza.",11171_8.jpg
39,1,39_1.jpg,"Breakfast was just finished, when Mrs. Shelby came. Chloe was not very pleased to see her. She was angry, and blamed her for letting Tom be sold.But Mrs. Shelby did not seem to see Aunt Chloe's angry looks. 'Tom,' she said, turning to him, 'I come to—' she could say no more, she was crying so bitterly.Then all Aunt Chloe's anger faded away.'Lor', now missis, don't-don't,' she said. She too burst out crying again, and for a few minutes they all sobbed together.'Tom,' said Mrs. Shelby at last, 'I can't do anything for you now. But I promise you, most solemnly, to save as much, money as I can. As soon as I have enough, I will buy you back again.'Just then Haley arrived. Tom said a last sad good-bye to his wife and children, and got into the cart, which Haley had brought with him.As soon as Tom was seated in the cart, Haley took a heavy chain, and fastened it round his ankles. Poor Tom had done nothing wrong, yet he was treated worse than a thief, just because he was a slave.'You don't need to do that,' said Mrs. Shelby, 'Tom won't run away.'",11171_9.jpg
39,2,39_2.jpg,"Eva and her father were standing by the railings as the boat once more began to move. It had hardly left the landing-stage when, some how or other, Eva lost her balance. She fell right over the side of the boat into the water.Tom was standing just under her, on the lower deck, as she fell. In one moment he sprang after her. The next he had caught her his arms, and was swimming with her to the boat-side, where eager hands were held out to take her.The whole boat was in confusion. Every one ran to help Eva, while the poor slave went back to his place, unnoticed and uncared for.But Mr. St. Clare did not forget.The next day Tom sat on the lower deck, with folded arms, anxiously watching him as he talked to Haley.Eva's father was a very handsome man. He was like Eva, with the same beautiful blue eyes and golden-brown hair. He was very fond of fun and laughter, and though he had quite made up his mind to buy Tom, he was now teasing Haley, and pretending to think that he was asking too much money for him.",11171_10.jpg
39,3,39_3.jpg,"'Papa do buy him, it's no matter what you pay', whispered Eva softly, putting her arms around her father's neck. 'You have money enough, I know. I want him.''What for, pussy? Are you going to use him for a rattle-box, or a rocking-horse, or what?''I want to make him happy.'Mr. St. Clare laughed; but after making a few more jokes about it, he gave Haley the money he asked for, and Tom had a new master.'Come, Eva,' said Mr. St. Clare, and, taking her hand, went across the boat to Tom.'Look up, Tom,' he said to him, 'and see how you like your new master.'Tom looked up. Mr. St. Clare had such a gay, young, handsome face, that Tom could not help feeling glad. Grateful tears rushed to his eyes as he said, 'God bless you, mas'r.''Can you drive horses, Tom?'",11171_11.jpg
40,0,40_0.jpg,"It made her quite ill to see Eva kissing and hugging the black slave women when she came home.'Well, I couldn't do that,' she said.'Why not?' said Mr. St. Clare, who was looking on.'Well, I want to be kind to every one. I wouldn't have anybody hurt. But, as to kissing niggers—' she gave a little shudder. 'How can she?'Presently a gay laugh sounded from the court. Mr. St. Clare stepped out to see what was happening.'What is it?' said Miss Ophelia, following him.There sat Tom on a little mossy seat in the court. Every one of his buttonholes was stuck full of flowers. Eva, laughing gaily, was hanging a wreath of roses round his neck. Then, still laughing, she perched on his knee like a little sparrow.'Oh, Tom, you look so funny!'",11171_12.jpg
40,1,40_1.jpg,"But as time went on, Uncle Tom longed more and more for his home. At last one day he had a grand idea. He would write a letter.Before Uncle Tom was sold, George Shelby had been teaching him to write so he thought he could manage a letter.He begged a sheet of writing-paper from Eva, and going to his room began to make a rough copy on his slate.It was very difficult. Poor Uncle Tom found that he had quite forgotten how to make some of the letters. Of those he did remember, he was not quite sure which he ought to use. Yes, it was a very difficult thing indeed.While he was working away, breathing very hard over it, Eva came behind him, and peeped over his shoulder.'Oh, Uncle Tom! what funny things you are making there!'Eva put her little golden head close to Uncle Tom's black one, and the two began a grave and anxious talk over the letter. They were both very earnest, and both very ignorant. But after a great deal of consulting over every word, the writing began, they really thought, to look quite like a proper letter.'Yes, Uncle Tom, it begins to look beautiful,' said Eva, gazing on it with delight. 'How pleased your wife will be, and the poor little children! Oh, it is a shame that you ever had to go away from them! I mean to ask papa to let you go back, some day.'",11171_13.jpg
40,2,40_2.jpg,"GEORGE FIGHTS FOR FREEDOMThe day after George and Eliza met each other once more at the end of so many sad months of parting, was a very happy one in the Quaker house.The two had much to say to each other. George had to tell how he had escaped from his cruel master, and how he had followed Eliza all the way and at last found her. Then there were plans to make for going on towards Canada. It was arranged that they should start that night at ten o'clock. 'The pursuers are hard after thee, we must not delay,' said Simeon.Rachel was happy and busy, packing up food and clothes for them to take on the journey.Late in the afternoon another Quaker, called Phineas, came with the dreadful news that the wicked men, whom Haley had sent to catch Eliza, were only a few miles away.So George and Eliza decided to start as soon as it was dark. A little while after supper a large covered waggon drew up before the door. They got in and the waggon drove off.On and on, all through the dark night they drove. About three o'clock, George heard the click of a horse's hoof coming behind them.'That's Simeon,' said Phineas, who was driving, as he pulled up the horses to listen.",11171_14.jpg
40,3,40_3.jpg,"On they went till they came to a place where the rocks rose straight up from the road like a wall. It seemed impossible for any one to climb up there. But Phineas knew a way.He stopped the horses. 'Here, Simeon,' he said, 'take the waggon, and drive on as fast as thou canst, and bring back help. Now follow me,' he said to the others, 'quick, for your lives. Run now, if you you ever did run.'Quicker than we can say it, they were following him up a tiny narrow path to the top of the rocks, and Simeon was galloping the horses with the empty waggon along the road.'We are pretty safe here,' said Phineas, when they had reached the top. 'Only one person can come up that path at a time. If any one tries it, shoot him.'The men who were chasing them had now arrived at the foot of of the rocks. They were led by a big man called Tom Loker, and another mean-looking little man, whom Haley had sent.After some hunting about, they found the path, and, headed by Tom Loker, began to climb up.'Come up if you like,' George called out, 'but if you do we will shoot you.'For answer, the little man took aim at George, and fired.",11171_15.jpg
41,0,41_0.jpg,"As soon as Phineas and the others saw that the wicked men had really ridden away, they climbed down, meaning to walk along the road till they met Simeon.They had just reached the bottom, when they saw him coming back with the waggon and two other men.'Now we are safe,' cried Phineas joyfully.'Well, do stop then,' said Eliza, 'and do something for that poor man. He is groaning dreadfully.''It would be no more than Christian,' said George. 'Let us take him with us.'They lifted the wounded man gently, as if he had been a friend instead of a cruel enemy, and laid him in the waggon. Then they all set out once more.A drive of about an hour brought them to a neat farm-house. There the tired travellers were kindly received and given a good breakfast.Tom Loker was put into a comfortable bed, far cleaner and softer than any he had ever slept in before. George and Eliza walked about the garden hand-in-hand, feeling happy together, and almost safe. They were so near Canada now.",11171_16.jpg
41,1,41_1.jpg,"'Do you know how to sew?' asked Miss Ophelia, quite shocked.'What can you do? What did you do for your master and mistress?''Fetch water, and wash dishes, and clean knives, and wait on folks.''Well, now, Topsy, I'm going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.''Yes, missis,' said Topsy, with a deep sigh and a face of woeful earnestness.'Now, Topsy, look here. This is the hem of the sheet. This is the right side of the sheet. This is the wrong. Will you remember?''Yes, missis,' said Topsy with another sigh.'Well, now, the under-sheet you must bring over the bolster—so, and tuck it right down under the mattress nice and smooth—so. Do you see?'",11171_17.jpg
41,2,41_2.jpg,"'Topsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.''Laws, missis, if you whip's all day, couldn't say no other way,' said Topsy, beginning to cry. 'I never seed dat ribbon. It must a caught in my sleeve. Miss Feely must'a left it on the bed, and it got caught in the clothes, and so got in my sleeve.'Miss Ophelia was so angry at such a barefaced lie that she caught Topsy and shook her. 'Don't tell me that again,' she said.The shake brought the gloves on the floor from the other sleeve.'There,' said Miss Ophelia, 'will you tell me now you didn't steal the ribbon?'Topsy now confessed to stealing the gloves. But she, still said she had not taken the ribbon.'Now, Topsy', said Miss Ophelia kindly, 'if you will confess all about it I won't whip you this time.'So Topsy confessed to having stolen both the ribbon and the gloves. She said she was very, very sorry, and would never do it again.",11171_18.jpg
41,3,41_3.jpg,"'I don't know what to do' she went on; 'I have taught and taught. I have talked till I'm tired. I've whipped her. I've punished her in every way I can think of, and still she is as naughty as she was at first.''Come here, Topsy, you monkey,' said Mr. St. Clare.Topsy came, her hard, round eyes glittering and blinking, half in fear, half in mischief.'What makes you behave so?' said Mr. St. Clare, who could not help being amused at her funny expression.'Spects it's my wicked heart; Miss Feely says so.''Don't you see how much Miss Ophelia has done for you? She says she has done everything she can think of.''Lor', yes, mas'r! Old missis used to say so, too. She whipped me a heap harder, and used to pull my hair and knock my head agin the door. But it didn't do me no good. I 'spect if they is to pull every hair out o' my head it wouldn't do no good neither. I's so wicked. Laws! I's nothin' but a nigger noways.''I shall have to give her up,' said Miss Ophelia. 'I can't have that trouble any longer.'",11171_19.jpg
42,0,42_0.jpg,"'Oh, Miss Eva, dear Miss Eva,' cried the poor little black child, 'I will try, I will try. I never did care nothin' about it before.'It soon became quite plain to everybody that Eva was very ill indeed. She never ran about and played now, but spent most of the day lying on the sofa in her own pretty room.Every one loved her, and tried to do things for her. Even naughty little Topsy used to bring her flowers, and try to be good for her sake.Uncle Tom was a great deal in Eva's room. She used to get very restless, and then she liked to be carried about. He was so big and strong that he could do it very easily. He would walk about with her under the orange-trees in the garden, or sitting down on some of their old seats, would sing their favorite hymns.He loved to do it, and could not bear to be long away from his little mistress. He gave up sleeping in his bed, and lay all night on the mat outside her door.One day Eva made her aunt cut off a lot of her beautiful hair. Then she called all the slaves together, said good-bye to them, and gave them each a curl of her hair as a keepsake. They all cried very much, and said they would never forget her, and would try to be good for her sake.A few nights later Miss Ophelia came quickly to Tom, as he lay on the mat outside Eva's door. 'Go, Tom,' she said, 'go as fast as you can for the doctor.'Tom ran. But in the morning little Eva lay on her bed, cold and white, with closed eyes and folded hands.",11171_20.jpg
42,1,42_1.jpg,"'Why, Tom, don't you think that you are really better off as you are?''No, indeed, Mas'r St. Clare,' said Tom, very decidedly; 'no, indeed.''But, Tom, you couldn't possibly have earned by your work such clothes and such nice, comfortable rooms and good food as I have given you.''I knows all that, Mas'r St. Clare. Mas'r has been too good. But, mas'r, I'd rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have 'em mine than have the best, and have 'em any man's else. I had so, mas'r. I thinks it's nature, mas'r.''I suppose so, Tom. You will be going off and leaving me, in a month or two,' he said, rather discontentedly. 'Though why you shouldn't, I don't know,' he added, in a gayer voice.'Not while mas'r is in trouble,' said Tom. 'I'll stay with mas'r as long as he wants me—so as I can be of any use.''Not while I am in trouble, Tom?' said Mr. St. Clare, looking sadly out of the window. 'And when will my trouble be over?' Then half-smiling he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom's shoulder. 'Ah, Tom, you soft, silly boy,' he said. 'I won't keep you. Go home to your wife and children, and give them all my love.''Cousin,' said Miss Ophelia, coming into the room, 'I want to speak to you about Topsy.'",11171_21.jpg
42,2,42_2.jpg,"'Nothing; she is a much better girl than she used to be. But I want to ask you, whose is she—yours or mine?''Why yours, of course; I gave her to you,' said Mr. St. Clare.'But not by law. There is no use my trying to make this child a Christian, unless I can be quite sure that she will not be sold as a slave again. If you are really willing I should have her, I want you to give me a paper saying she is mine.''But you think it is wicked to keep slaves. Now you want to have one of your own. Oh! shocking, cousin,' said Mr. St. Clare, who loved to tease.'Nonsense! I only want to have her, so that I can set her free.''Very well,' said Mr. St. Clare, 'I will write the paper for you.' Then he sat down and began to read.'But I want it done now,' said Miss Ophelia.'Why are you in such a hurry?'",11171_22.jpg
42,3,42_3.jpg,"It was a lovely day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and sparkling, in the sunlight. Hour after hour the boat steamed on.Night came; and in the morning, clear and beautiful before them, rose the shores of Canada.George and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat came near the little town, where they were going to land. His breath came thick and short; a mist gathered before his eyes; he silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his arm.The bell rang—the boat stopped.Scarcely seeing what he did, George looked out his luggage, and gathered his little party.They were landed on the shore, and stood still till the boat had started again.Then with tears of joy, the husband and wife, with their wondering little boy in their arms, knelt down and lifted up their hearts to God. They were free.UNCLE TOM FINDS FREEDOM",11171_23.jpg

43,3,43_3.jpg," would see the lights on Kingsbridge twinkle in the dusk, reminding us of tea-time and warm fires.“I would sit on the river-wall with my feet dangling over the water”Another friend I had was Matthew Mugg, the cat’s-meat-man. He was a funny old person with a bad squint. He looked rather awful but he was really quite nice to talk to. He knew everybody in Puddleby; and he knew all the dogs and all the cats. In those times being a cat’s-meat-man was a regular business. And you could see one nearly any day going through the streets with a wooden tray full of pieces of meat stuck on skewers crying, “Meat! M-E-A-T!” People paid him to give this meat to their cats and dogs instead of feeding them on dog-biscuits or the scraps from the table.I enjoyed going round with old Matthew and seeing the cats and dogs come running to the garden-gates whenever they heard his call. Sometimes he let me give the meat to the animals myself; and I thought this was great fun. He knew a lot about dogs and he would tell me the names of the different kinds as we went through the town. He had several dogs of his own; one, a whippet, was a very fast runner, and Matthew used to win prizes with her at the Saturday coursing races; another, a terrier, was a fine ratter. The cat’s-meat-man used to make a business of rat-catching for the millers and farmers as well as his other trade of selling cat’s-meat.My third great friend was Luke the Hermit. But of him I will tell you more later on.",1154_3.jpg

44,1,44_1.jpg," a few lessons myself. And once you get started you’ll be surprised how fast you get on. It would indeed be a good thing if you could learn. Because then you could do some of the work for the Doctor—I mean the easier work, like bandaging and giving pills. Yes, yes, that’s a good idea of mine. ’Twould be a great thing if the poor man could get some help—and some rest. It is a scandal the way he works. I see no reason why you shouldn’t be able to help him a great deal—That is, if you are really interested in animals.”“‘Being a good noticer is terribly important’”“Oh, I’d love that!” I cried. “Do you think the Doctor would let me?”“Certainly,” said Polynesia—“as soon as you have learned something about doctoring. I’ll speak of it to him myself—Sh! I hear him coming. Quick—bring his bacon back on to the table.”",1154_5.jpg
44,2,44_2.jpg," were something in the way. And then I noticed that it took hold of the bars with its feet, so that it really had four hands to climb with. But it was only when I at last got a glimpse of the face under the hat that I could be really sure it was a monkey.Chee-Chee—for it was he—frowned at me suspiciously from the top of the gate, as though he thought I was going to laugh at him like the other boys and girls. Then he dropped into the garden on the inside and immediately started taking off his clothes. He tore the straw hat in two and threw it down into the road. Then he took off his bodice and skirt, jumped on them savagely and began kicking them round the front garden.Presently I heard a screech from the house, and out flew Polynesia, followed by the Doctor and Jip.“Chee-Chee!—Chee-Chee!” shouted the parrot. “You’ve come at last! I always told the Doctor you’d find a way. How ever did you do it?”They all gathered round him shaking him by his four hands, laughing and asking him a million questions at once. Then they all started back for the house.“Run up to my bedroom, Stubbins,” said the Doctor, turning to me. “You’ll find a bag of peanuts in the small left-hand drawer of the bureau. I have always kept them there in case he might come back unexpectedly some day. And wait a minute—see if Dab-Dab has any bananas in the pantry.",1154_6.jpg

45,2,45_2.jpg,"—a paper which said what a good sailor he was—and implored us, if we valued our lives, to take him.“‘Boy, where’s the skipper?’”But the Doctor was quite firm—polite but determined—and finally the man walked sorrowfully away, telling us he never expected to see us alive again.Callers of one sort and another kept us quite busy that morning. The Doctor had no sooner gone below to stow away his note-books than another visitor appeared upon the gang-plank. This was a most extraordinary-looking black man. The only other negroes I had seen had been in circuses, where they wore feathers and bone necklaces and things like that. But this one was dressed in a fashionable frock coat with an enormous bright red cravat. On his head was a straw hat with a gay band; and over this he held a large green umbrella. He was very smart in every respect except his feet. He wore no shoes or socks.“Pardon me,” said he, bowing elegantly, “but is this the ship of the physician Dolittle?”“Yes,” I said, “did you wish to see him?”“I did—if it will not be discommodious,” he answered.“Who shall I say it is?”“I am Bumpo Kahbooboo, Crown Prince of Jolliginki.”",1154_10.jpg
45,3,45_3.jpg," than any of us, and really knew a lot about running ships, seemed to be always awake—except when she took her couple of winks in the sun, standing on one leg beside the wheel. You may be sure that no one ever got a chance to stay abed more than his eight hours while Polynesia was around. She used to watch the ship’s clock; and if you overslept a half-minute, she would come down to the cabin and peck you gently on the nose till you got up.“In these lower levels we came upon the shadowy shapes of dead ships”",1154_11.jpg
46,0,46_0.jpg, But I suppose if they had been invited to go to bed on a pavement in front of a shop they wouldn’t have cared for the idea at all. It is funny how some people are.“The Doctor started chatting in Spanish to the bed-maker”,1154_12.jpg
46,1,46_1.jpg," rules of bullfighting. (“Ha!” Polynesia chuckled into my ear. “It’s like the Doctor’s navigation: he breaks all the rules; but he gets there. If they’ll only let him, he’ll give them the best show for their money they ever saw.”) A great argument began. Half the people seemed to be on Pepito’s side and half on the Doctor’s side. At last the Doctor turned to Pepito and made another very grand bow which burst the last button off his waistcoat.“Did acrobatics on the beast’s horns”“Well, of course if the caballero is afraid—” he began with a bland smile.“Afraid!” screamed Pepito. “I am afraid of nothing on earth. I am the greatest matador in Spain. With this right hand I have killed nine hundred and fifty-seven bulls.”“All right then,” said the Doctor, “let us see if you can kill five more. Let the bulls in!” he shouted. “Pepito de Malaga is not afraid.”A dreadful silence hung over the great theatre as the heavy door into the bull pen was rolled back. Then with a roar the five big bulls bounded into the ring.“Look fierce,” I heard the Doctor call to them in cattle language. “Don’t scatter. Keep close. Get ready for a rush. Take Pepito, the one in purple, first. But for Heaven’s sake don’t kill him. Just chase him out of the ring—Now then, all together, go for him!”The bulls put down their heads and all in line,",1154_13.jpg
46,2,46_2.jpg," not sure whether I’m dreaming—Can’t believe my own senses. I—I—I—”“Why, Doctor,” I said, “what is it?—What’s the matter?”“The fidgit,” he whispered, pointing with a trembling finger to the listening-tank in which the little round fish was still swimming quietly, “he talks English! And—and—and “Talks English!” I cried—“Whistles!—Why, it’s impossible.”“It’s a fact,” said the Doctor, white in the face with excitement. “It’s only a few words, scattered, with no particular sense to them—all mixed up with his own language which I can’t make out yet. But they’re English words, unless there’s something very wrong with my hearing—And the tune he whistles, it’s as plain as anything—always the same tune. Now you listen and tell me what you make of it. Tell me everything you hear. Don’t miss a word.”I went to the glass tank upon the table while the Doctor grabbed a note-book and a pencil. Undoing my collar I stood upon the empty packing-case he had been using for a stand and put my right ear down under the water.For some moments I detected nothing at all—except, with my dry ear, the heavy breathing of the Doctor as he waited, all stiff and anxious, for me to say something. At last from within the water",1154_14.jpg
46,3,46_3.jpg,“I was alone in the ocean!”,1154_15.jpg
47,0,47_0.jpg," But the Indian knew no English of course, and the Doctor knew no Indian. Presently, to my surprise, I heard the Doctor trying him in different animal languages.“It was a great moment”“How do you do?” he said in dog-talk; “I am glad to see you,” in horse-signs; “How long have you been buried?” in deer-language. Still the Indian made no move but stood there, straight and stiff, understanding not a word.The Doctor tried again, in several other animal dialects. But with no result.Till at last he came to the language of eagles.“Great Red-Skin,” he said in the fierce screams and short grunts that the big birds use, “never have I been so glad in all my life as I am to-day to find you still alive.”In a flash Long Arrow’s stony face lit up with a smile of understanding; and back came the answer in eagle-tongue,“Mighty White Man, I owe my life to you. For the remainder of my days I am your servant to command.”Afterwards Long Arrow told us that this was the only bird or animal language that he had ever been able to learn. But that he had not spoken it in a long time, for no eagles ever came to this island.",1154_16.jpg
47,1,47_1.jpg," and right from the start it gave way in one place after another as the enemy thronged and crowded against it. Then the Doctor, Long Arrow and Bumpo would hurry to the weak spot, a terrific hand-to-hand fight would take place and the enemy be thrown out. But almost instantly a cry of alarm would come from some other part of the village-wall; and the Three would have to rush off and do the same thing all over again.From an Indian rock-engraving found on Hawks’-Head Mountain, Spidermonkey IslandThe Popsipetels were themselves no mean fighters; but the strength and weight of those three men of different lands and colors, standing close together, swinging their enormous war-clubs, was really a sight for the wonder and admiration of any one.Many weeks later when I was passing an Indian camp-fire at night I heard this song being sung. It has since become one of the traditional folksongs of the Popsipetels.THE SONG OF THE TERRIBLE THREEOh hear ye the Song of the Terrible ThreeAnd the fight that they fought by the edge of the sea.Down from the mountains, the rocks and the crags,Swarming like wasps, came the Bag-jagderags.",1154_17.jpg
47,2,47_2.jpg," scenery. It was like a great vast basin, or circus, in the mountains, and out of the centre of it there rose a table of rock with an ivory chair upon it. All around this the mountains went up like stairs, or theatre-seats, to a great height—except at one narrow end which was open to a view of the sea. You could imagine it a council-place or concert-hall for giants, and the rock table in the centre the stage for performers or the stand for the speaker.“Working away with their noses against the end of the island”We asked our guides why it was called the Whispering Rocks; and they said, “Go down into it and we will show you.”The great bowl was miles deep and miles wide. We scrambled down the rocks and they showed us how, even when you stood far, far apart from one another, you merely had to whisper in that great place and every one in the theatre could hear you. This was, the Doctor said, on account of the echoes which played backwards and forwards between the high walls of rock.Our guides told us that it was here, in days long gone by when the Popsipetels owned the whole of Spidermonkey Island, that the kings were crowned. The ivory chair upon the table was the throne in which they sat. And so great was the big theatre that all the Indians in the island were able to get seats in it to see the ceremony.They showed us also an enormous hanging stone perched on the edge of a volcano’s crater—the",1154_18.jpg
47,3,47_3.jpg," highest summit in the whole island. Although it was very far below us, we could see it quite plainly; and it looked wobbly enough to be pushed off its perch with the hand. There was a legend among the people, they said, that when the greatest of all Popsipetel kings should be crowned in the ivory chair, this hanging stone would tumble into the volcano’s mouth and go straight down to the centre of the earth.The Doctor said he would like to go and examine it closer.And when we were come to the lip of the volcano (it took us half a day to get up to it) we found the stone was unbelievably large—big as a cathedral. Underneath it we could look right down into a black hole which seemed to have no bottom. The Doctor explained to us that volcanoes sometimes spurted up fire from these holes in their tops; but that those on floating islands were always cold and dead.“Stubbins,” he said, looking up at the great stone towering above us, “do you know what would most likely happen if that boulder should fall in?”“No,” said I, “what?”“You remember the air-chamber which the porpoises told us lies under the centre of the island?”“Well, this stone is heavy enough, if it fell into",1154_19.jpg
48,0,48_3.jpg," HERE was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid.  He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen.  On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming.  There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all.  For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten.  For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about him.  He was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed him.  The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they were real.  The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms.  The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles.  Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with Government.  Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse.  The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.  He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces.  He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else.  For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room.  ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse.  ""It's a thing that happens to you.  When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful.  ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse.  ""You become.  It takes a long time.  That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.  Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.  But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."" ",11757_0.jpg

And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive.  But the Skin Horse only smiled. The Skin Horse Tells His Story ""The Boy's Uncle made me Real,"" he said.  ""That was a great many years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again.  It lasts for always.""  The Rabbit sighed.  He thought it would be a long time before this magic called Real happened to him.  He longed to become Real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad.  He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him.  There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery.  Sometimes she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled them away in cupboards.  She called this ""tidying up,"" and the playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones.  The Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft.  One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him.  Nana was in a hurry, and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop.  ""Here,"" she said, ""take your old Bunny!  He'll do to sleep with you!""   And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy's arms.  That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed.  At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe.  And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse.  But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in.  And they had splendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece.  And when the Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long.  And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy–so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him.

Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too.  He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border.  And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there.  He was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron.  ""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said.  ""Fancy all that fuss for a toy!""  The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.  ""Give me my Bunny!"" he said.  ""You mustn't say that.  He isn't a toy.  He's REAL!""  When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last.  The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer.  He was Real.  The Boy himself had said it.  That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst.  And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!""  That was a wonderful Summer!  Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play.  He took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable.  One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him.  They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new.  They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did.  Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up.  But he couldn't see it.  They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether. ",11757_2.jpg

""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked.  ""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork.  ""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit.  ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs.  ""I don't believe you can!"" he said.  ""I can!"" said the little Rabbit.  ""I can jump higher than anything!"" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so.  ""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit.  That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all!  The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion.

49,1,49_1.jpg,"THE WISE MAMMA GOOSE Mamma Goose was trying to think. She had left the barnyard because it was   so noisy there that she could not collect her wits, and had hidden herself between   the rows of tall red hollyhocks which border one side of the garden. Here, at   least, it was quiet.  Thinking had always been hard work for Mamma Goose. And besides, her family kept her so busy that she had no time for it anyway. There was always something to be done for the babies. ",11936_1.jpg
49,2,49_2.jpg,"For Mamma   Goose had a whole dozen of the dearest little goslings, and she was very proud   of them. They were soft, and round, and fluffy, like little yellow balls, and   besides being prettier than any other babies in the barnyard, they were so bright,   too, and knew as much as any gosling could be expected to know,--far more than   little Red Hen's chicks, even though she did make such a fuss about them!  The goslings could hunt for their breakfasts almost as well as their mother, while little Red Hen had to scratch up every thing her children ate. And as for the water--well, the chicks were simply not in it there! They did not like to be in the water at all, but the goslings loved their morning bath in the brook better than anything else in the whole day.  Yes, her goslings were by far the finer babies! Mamma Goose swelled with pride when she thought of it, and carefully smoothed her feathers. She could have been perfectly happy except for just one thing. She was afraid that before long something dreadful might happen to the goslings, and once more she settled herself to think.  There was something wrong in the barnyard. What could it be that came each   night when every one was sound asleep? And what was it that carried one of the   chickens away each time so that, when the next morning came, there was always   one less than there had been the day before? Whatever it was, it made no noise.   Only, always the next morning some one was missing, and usually it was a little   baby chick that was gone. The worst of it was that no one else knew any more   about it than she did. To be sure, little Bantam Rooster had said it was the   hawk. But then Bantam always thought he knew everything, and was almost always   wrong, so that nobody ever believed anything he said. ",11936_2.jpg
49,3,49_3.jpg,"Besides,   if it had been, the big white cock would have known it, for the big white cock   knew everything. He was the king of the barnyard, and took care of them all.   He had a bright red comb and beautiful, long, green tail-feathers, and Mamma   Goose thought him the most wonderful being in the whole world.  But something seemed to be wrong with him, too. He did not crow half so often as he used to, and his beautiful red comb did not stand stiff and straight any more. It drooped to one side and he looked very tired and very unhappy, as if he, too, had been trying to think. But if he did not know what it was that came night after night, then nobody knew.  Everything had been very different when old Fido lived in his little house   by the barnyard gate. Nothing had ever happened to trouble them then. But old   Fido was gone now, and nobody knew about that either. One morning after breakfast   he had trotted off behind the wagon, and nobody had seen him since. Every one   liked old Fido, and they all missed him, but he had never come back and his   little house stood empty all night long. ",11936_3.jpg
50,0,50_0.jpg,"Some thought   that he had gone to take care of the sheep who lived in the big field on the   other side of the hill. But it was only little Bantam Rooster who said so. Nobody   knew. Things had been better, though, before Fido went away, for he had always   stayed awake all night and watched to see that no harm came to any of them.  Then suddenly Mamma Goose had a thought, and a very bright idea it was, too.   She would stay awake all night herself, and watch and see with her own eyes   what it was that carried away the little chicks. As soon as she had made this   plan she stopped thinking, for it was such hard work and the sun was getting   very hot on her poor head. Besides, the goslings had been in the water long   enough. They never did know when to come out!  So she waddled down to the brook to get them. Then they all went for a walk   in the meadow where the red clover-tops nod in the wind, and Mamma Goose did   no more thinking that day.  But when night came, she did not forget her plan. As soon as the sun had gone down behind the hill, the chickens all perched themselves along the roost with the big white cock at the end of the row, and soon they were all fast asleep. Little Red Hen gathered her chicks under her wing to keep them cosy and warm, and then she, too, went to sleep.  Mamma Goose tucked her babies in also, and spread her wings wide over them all, but she did not go to sleep. ",11936_4.jpg
50,1,50_1.jpg,"Instead,   she kept both eyes wide open and stared straight at the big white cock, that   she might not go to sleep without knowing it. It was very hard to sit so long   in the dark and keep awake. First one eye and then the other would close tight,   but Mamma Goose would stretch them wide open again, and stare harder than ever   at the big cock, and then she saw that the cock was watching, too, and that   made it much easier.  Then it happened after a long time, when the moon had climbed high above the   trees, and everything was very quiet, that a long, slim fox stole softly beneath   the fence and came creeping--creeping across the barn yard. Mamma Goose was   so frightened that she almost said ""Quack! quack!"" out loud, but still she kept   her eyes on the big white cock, and that was a great help.  The fox was creeping softly toward the roost where the chickens slept in a row,--but not straight toward it. He was keeping as far away from old Fido's house as he possibly could. Although she was so frightened, Mamma Goose wondered why. She had always heard that the fox was afraid of old Fido, but didn't he know that Fido was far away? Didn't he know that his little house was empty? It did not take the fox long, however, to creep softly past it, and in the morning another little chick was gone! ",11936_5.jpg
50,2,50_2.jpg,"But a new   thought had come to Mamma Goose. If the fox would not go near old Fido's house,   then he could not find the goslings if they hid inside. It seemed to Mamma Goose   the only thing to do, and a very sensible plan indeed. She would ask all the   chickens to come in, too, and then they would all be safe!  But when she went the next day to her best friends and told them about her   plan, most of them only made fun of her, and all of them turned their backs   on her. No one would listen!  But Mamma Goose was not to be talked out of it. If the others wished to sit still and let the fox carry them away one at a time, that was one thing, but for her to do nothing to keep her little goslings safe,--that was quite another. ",11936_6.jpg
50,3,50_3.jpg,"So that   very evening, when the sun had gone down behind the hill, and the chickens had   perched themselves on the roost with the big cock at the end, Mamma Goose led   all the little goslings into Fido's house. Every one laughed when she went in,   but Mamma Goose had made up her mind, and she kept straight on as if she had   not heard them! But the big white cock--he did not laugh at her!  So every night Mamma Goose led her babies into Fido's house, and every morning   brought them out again safe and whole. But always a little chick was missing!  Then one night when the sun was sinking low, the big white cock flew up to the top of the fence and crowed. All the chickens listened then, while he told them that they were every one to go into old Fido's house that night with Mamma Goose; for that was the only way to keep the fox from carrying them all away.

52,3,52_3.jpg,"""So, fair and softly!"" John he cried,But John he cried in vain;That trot became a gallop soon,In spite of curb and rein.So stooping down, as needs he mustWho cannot sit upright,He grasped the mane with both his hands,And eke with all his might.",11979_7.jpg

73,3,73_3.jpg,"When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the ""Flopsy Bunnies.""",14220_3.jpg
74,0,74_0.jpg,"As there was not always quite enough to eat,—Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.",14220_4.jpg
74,1,74_1.jpg,Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.,14220_5.jpg
74,2,74_2.jpg,"When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day—oh joy!—there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had ""shot"" into flower.",14220_6.jpg
74,3,74_3.jpg,"The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.",14220_7.jpg
75,0,75_0.jpg,Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.,14220_8.jpg
75,1,75_1.jpg,"The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)",14220_9.jpg
75,2,75_2.jpg,"She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.",14220_10.jpg
75,3,75_3.jpg,"While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.",14220_11.jpg
76,0,76_0.jpg,The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time.,14220_12.jpg
76,1,76_1.jpg,"Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap—""One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!"" said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.",14220_13.jpg
76,2,76_2.jpg,Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.He went to put away the mowing machine.,14220_14.jpg

77,0,77_0.jpg,"Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.",14220_16.jpg
77,1,77_1.jpg,"The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.",14220_17.jpg
77,2,77_2.jpg,Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.,14220_18.jpg
77,3,77_3.jpg,"Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.",14220_19.jpg
78,0,78_0.jpg,The watched him go into his house.And then they crept up to the window to listen.,14220_20.jpg
78,1,78_1.jpg,"Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle—""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!"" said Mr. McGregor.",14220_21.jpg
78,2,78_2.jpg,"""Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?"" enquired Mrs. McGregor.""One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!"" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers—""one, two, three—""""Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?""""In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!"" replied Mr. McGregor.(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)",14220_22.jpg
78,3,78_3.jpg,"Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be  rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.""Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.""""Line your old cloak?"" shouted Mr. McGregor—""I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!""""Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.""",14220_23.jpg
79,0,79_0.jpg,"Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had ""done it a purpose.""",14220_24.jpg
79,1,79_1.jpg,"And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.It was rather hurt.",14220_25.jpg
79,2,79_2.jpg,Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.,14220_26.jpg
79,3,79_3.jpg,"So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.",14220_27.jpg

80,1,80_1.jpg,"One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.",14407_1.jpg
80,2,80_2.jpg,"As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off—with a hop, skip, and a jump—to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.",14407_2.jpg
80,3,80_3.jpg,"That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).",14407_3.jpg
81,0,81_0.jpg,"Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.",14407_4.jpg
81,1,81_1.jpg,"Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.",14407_5.jpg
81,2,81_2.jpg,"""Peter,"" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, ""who has got your clothes?""Peter replied, ""The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,"" and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.",14407_6.jpg
81,3,81_3.jpg,"Peter said he hoped that it would rain.At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: ""Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!""Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.",14407_7.jpg
82,0,82_0.jpg,"They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.",14407_8.jpg
82,1,82_1.jpg,"Little Benjamin said: ""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.""Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.It had been sown with lettuces.",14407_9.jpg
82,2,82_2.jpg,"They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.",14407_10.jpg
82,3,82_3.jpg,"Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.",14407_11.jpg
83,0,83_0.jpg,"Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.",14407_12.jpg
83,1,83_1.jpg,"Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)The lettuces certainly were very fine.",14407_13.jpg
83,2,83_2.jpg,Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions.,14407_14.jpg
83,3,83_3.jpg,"Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.",14407_15.jpg
84,0,84_0.jpg,Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.,14407_16.jpg
84,1,84_1.jpg,"They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.",14407_17.jpg
84,2,84_2.jpg,"This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket....",14407_18.jpg

85,2,85_2.jpg,"Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.",14407_22.jpg
85,3,85_3.jpg,"When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.Then he took out his nephew Peter.",14407_23.jpg

86,1,86_1.jpg,"Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.",14797_1.jpg
86,2,86_2.jpg,"Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled—""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch—""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."" ""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,"" replied prudent Timothy.",14797_2.jpg
86,3,86_3.jpg,"When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.",14797_3.jpg
87,0,87_0.jpg,"Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.",14797_4.jpg
87,1,87_1.jpg,"When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled down—down—down inside.""How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!"" said Goody.""I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,"" said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.",14797_5.jpg
87,2,87_2.jpg,"They did collect quantities—because they did not lose them! Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels began to dig,—the whole wood was in commotion!",14797_6.jpg
87,3,87_3.jpg,"Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.The first one sang—""Who's bin digging-up And another sang—""Little bita bread and--cheese! Little bit-a-bread an'-",14797_7.jpg
88,0,88_0.jpg,"The squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang—""Who's-bin digging-up  nuts? Who's been digging-up Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.",14797_8.jpg
88,1,88_1.jpg,"But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting—""Who's-been digging-up ",14797_9.jpg
88,2,88_2.jpg,"They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. ""We will leave him here till he confesses,"" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole—",14797_10.jpg
88,3,88_3.jpg,"Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still.",14797_11.jpg
89,0,89_0.jpg,"Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.She wandered all over the wood, calling—""Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?""",14797_12.jpg
89,1,89_1.jpg,"In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its night-cap; and the house was full of provisions.",14797_13.jpg
89,2,89_2.jpg,"The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree—""Besides, I found a few buried!"" It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities—""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? My wife will be anxious!"" ""Just another nut—or two nuts; let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!",14797_14.jpg
89,3,89_3.jpg,"Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.",14797_15.jpg
90,0,90_0.jpg,"""It is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?""""I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here,"" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; ""but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."" ""I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me,"" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.",14797_16.jpg
90,1,90_1.jpg,"She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together—""My little old man and I fell out,How shall we bring this matter about?Bring it about as well as you can,And get you gone, you little old man!""",14797_17.jpg
90,2,90_2.jpg,"""You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,"" said Goody Tiptoes. ""Yes, I could,"" said the Chipmunk, ""but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!""Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang—""For the diddlum dayDay diddle dum di!Day diddle diddle dum day!""",14797_18.jpg
90,3,90_3.jpg,"Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down—""Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"" And Timmy replied, ""Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why, certainly!""He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.",14797_19.jpg
91,0,91_0.jpg,"And so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.",14797_20.jpg
91,1,91_1.jpg,"But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.",14797_21.jpg
91,2,91_2.jpg,At last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.,14797_22.jpg
91,3,91_3.jpg,Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!,14797_23.jpg

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

109,0,109_0.jpg,"One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat—a coat of cherry-coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses, and a cream coloured satin waistcoat—trimmed with gauze and green worsted chenille—for the Mayor of Gloucester.The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself. He measured the silk, and turned it round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his shears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets.""No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!"" said the Tailor of Gloucester.When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window-panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.",14868_4.jpg
109,1,109_1.jpg,"There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket flaps and cuffs, and buttons all in order. For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta; and for the button-holes of the waistcoat, there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient—except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.The tailor came out of his shop at dark, for he did not sleep there at nights; he fastened the window and locked the door, and took away the key. No one lived there at night but little brown mice, and they run in and out without any keys!For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long narrow passages; they can run all over the town without going into the streets.",14868_5.jpg

109,3,109_3.jpg,"Now all day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by himself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin for coats!""Miaw?"" said the cat when the tailor opened the door. ""Miaw?""The tailor replied—""Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence) and Simpkin, take a china pipkin; buy a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk and a penn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence buy me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST.""",14868_7.jpg
110,0,110_0.jpg,"Then Simpkin again said, ""Miaw?"" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.""I shall make my fortune—to be cut bias—the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat—to be lined with yellow taffeta—and the taffeta sufficeth; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make tippets for mice——""Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises—Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!""Now what can that be?"" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins, willow pattern plates, and tea-cups and mugs.",14868_8.jpg
110,1,110_1.jpg,"The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles.

110,2,110_2.jpg,"Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a curtsey to the tailor! Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and mumbling to himself——""The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin—tambour stitch and rose-buds in beautiful floss silk. Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence to Simpkin? One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured twist!""But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises:Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!""This is passing extraordinary!"" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.",14868_10.jpg
110,3,110_3.jpg,"Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!And then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all sounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old worm-eaten window-shutter—Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tipAnd out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.",14868_11.jpg
111,0,111_0.jpg,"The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting—""One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have no more twist!""The little mice came out again, and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining, and about little mouse tippets.And then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another, as they ran from house to house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back with the pipkin of milk!",14868_12.jpg
111,1,111_1.jpg,"Simpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry ""G-r-r-miaw!"" like a cat that is vexed: for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears, and snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and the sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.""Simpkin,"" said the tailor, ""where is my twist?""But Simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!""Simpkin,"" said the tailor, ""where is my TWIST?""",14868_13.jpg
111,2,111_2.jpg,"But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: ""Where is my MOUSE?""""Alack, I am undone!"" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!Whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said ""Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!"" and made strange horrid noises, as cats do at night.For the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled—""No more twist! no more twist!""All that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should become of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate Street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the table—one-and-twenty button-holes—and who should come to sew them, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?",14868_14.jpg
111,3,111_3.jpg,But that does not hinder the little brown mice; they run in and out without any keys through all the old houses in Gloucester!,14868_15.jpg
112,0,112_0.jpg,"Out of doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no Christmas dinner for Simpkin and the poor old Tailor of Gloucester.The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night. The moon climbed up over the roofs and chimneys, and looked down over the gateway into College Court. There were no lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of Gloucester was fast asleep under the snow.And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and he mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.",14868_16.jpg
112,1,112_1.jpg,"But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk, in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer—like an echo of the chimes—and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes—all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.",14868_17.jpg
112,2,112_2.jpg,"First and loudest the cocks cried out: ""Dame, get up, and bake your pies!""""Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly!"" sighed Simpkin.And now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came from over the way.""Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in Gloucester—except me,"" said Simpkin.Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jack-daws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full of little twittering tunes.",14868_18.jpg
112,3,112_3.jpg,"But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin!Particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a wooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very small voices—especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep, like the Tailor of Gloucester.They said something mysterious that sounded like—""Buz, quoth the blue fly, hum, quoth the bee,Buz and hum they cry, and so do we!""and Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.",14868_19.jpg
113,0,113_0.jpg,"From the tailor's shop in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily—Went to catch a snail,The best man amongst themDurst not touch her tail,She put out her hornsLike a little kyloe cow,Run, tailors, run! or she'll have you all e'en now!""Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again—",14868_20.jpg
113,1,113_1.jpg,"""Mew! Mew!"" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor's pillow, he could not get in.The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune—""Three little mice sat down to spin,Pussy passed by and she peeped in.What are you at, my fine little men?Making coats for gentlemen.Shall I come in and cut off your threads?Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!""",14868_21.jpg
113,2,113_2.jpg,"They clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.""And then I boughtA pipkin and a popkin,A slipkin and a slopkin,All for one farthing——and upon the kitchen dresser!"" added the rude little mice.""Mew! scratch! scratch!"" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices: ""No more twist! No more twist!"" And they barred up the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles, and little mouse voices singing—",14868_22.jpg
113,3,113_3.jpg,"Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!",14868_23.jpg
114,0,114_0.jpg,"""Alack, I am worn to a ravelling,"" said the Tailor of Gloucester, ""but I have my twist!""The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins sang—but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung in the night.""Alack,"" said the tailor, ""I have my twist; but no more strength—nor time—than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon—and where is his cherry-coloured coat?""He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!The boards were swept clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.",14868_24.jpg
114,1,114_1.jpg,"But upon the table—oh joy! the tailor gave a shout—there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk—there lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester.",14868_25.jpg
114,2,114_2.jpg,"There were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured button-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words—in little teeny weeny writing—And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.",14868_26.jpg
114,3,114_3.jpg,"He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But his button-holes were the greatest triumph of it all.The stitches of those button-holes were so neat— neat—I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.The stitches of those button-holes were so small— small—they looked as if they had been made by little mice!",14868_27.jpg
115,0,115_1.jpg,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,14872_0.jpg
115,1,115_1.jpg,"This is a Tale about a tail—a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.",14872_1.jpg
115,2,115_2.jpg,"In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.",14872_2.jpg
115,3,115_3.jpg,"One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green—Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.",14872_3.jpg
116,0,116_0.jpg,"They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.",14872_4.jpg
116,1,116_1.jpg,"They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely—""Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?""",14872_5.jpg
116,2,116_2.jpg,"But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red ""Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!A little wee man, in a red red coat!A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.""Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.",14872_6.jpg
116,3,116_3.jpg,"The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.",14872_7.jpg
117,0,117_0.jpg,"But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said—""Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?""",14872_8.jpg
117,1,117_1.jpg,"But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a ""Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!Hitty Pitty within the wall,Hitty Pitty without the wall;If you touch Hitty Pitty,Hitty Pitty will bite you!""Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.",14872_9.jpg
117,2,117_2.jpg,"He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue  from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang—""A house full, a hole full!And you cannot gather a bowl-full!""",14872_10.jpg
117,3,117_3.jpg,"The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.But Nutkin gathered oak-apples—yellow and scarlet—and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.",14872_11.jpg
118,0,118_0.jpg,On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.,14872_12.jpg
118,1,118_1.jpg,"Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing—""The man in the wilderness said to me,'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'I answered him as I thought good—'As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'""But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles—not even when the answer was provided for him.",14872_13.jpg
118,2,118_2.jpg,"On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in  for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever—""Old Mr. B! riddle-me-reeFlour of England, fruit of Spain,Met together in a shower of rain;Put in a bag tied round with a string,If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!""",14872_14.jpg
118,3,118_3.jpg,"The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.",14872_15.jpg
119,0,119_0.jpg,"On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble  nest on the tippitty top of the hill.But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing—""Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!As I went over Tipple-tineI met a flock of bonny swine;Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!They were the very bonniest swine",14872_16.jpg
119,1,119_1.jpg,Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.But he ate up the honey!,14872_17.jpg
119,2,119_2.jpg,"The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.",14872_18.jpg
119,3,119_3.jpg,"On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid  in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting—""Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,With a white counterpane round his neck,Forty doctors and forty wrights,Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!""",14872_19.jpg
120,0,120_0.jpg,Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.,14872_20.jpg
120,1,120_1.jpg,"Nutkin became more and more impertinent—""Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;All the King's horses, and all the King's men,Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,Off the King's kitchen door.""Nutkin danced up and down like a ; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.",14872_21.jpg
120,2,120_2.jpg,"""Arthur O'Bower has broken his band,He comes roaring up the land!The King of Scots with all his power,Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!""Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the , and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!...Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud ""Squeak!""The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.",14872_22.jpg
120,3,120_3.jpg,"When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree—there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.",14872_23.jpg

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.

Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

She was a good little girl—only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying—oh, she did cry so! ""I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have  seen them, Tabby Kitten?""",15137_2.jpg
135,3,135_3.jpg,"The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen—But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking—""I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!""",15137_3.jpg
136,0,136_0.jpg,"And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town—a hill that goes up—up—into the clouds as though it had no top!And a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.",15137_4.jpg
136,1,136_1.jpg,Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way—up and up—until Little-town was right away down below—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!,15137_5.jpg
136,2,136_2.jpg,"Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water—but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup!

136,3,136_3.jpg,"The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes—props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins—but no pocket-handkerchiefs!But there was something else—a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing—""Lily-white and clean, oh!With little frills between, oh!Smooth and hot—red rusty spotNever here be seen, oh!""",15137_7.jpg
137,0,137_0.jpg,"Lucie, knocked—once—twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out ""Who's that?""Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?—a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams—just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.",15137_8.jpg

140,1,140_1.jpg,"""Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were  sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.",15137_21.jpg
140,2,140_2.jpg,"When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.",15137_22.jpg
140,3,140_3.jpg,Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!,15137_23.jpg

142,1,142_1.gif,"And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out ""isn't mouse"" and changed it to ""I hope it will be fine,"" and she gave her letter to the postman.But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.""I am dreadfully afraid it  be mouse!"" said Duchess to herself—""I really couldn't,  eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And  pie was going to be veal and ham.

Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearthrug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.",15234_2.gif

I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!""",15234_4.gif
143,1,143_1.gif,"She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. ""I am glad I used the  oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can there really have been someone in the house?""Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.""I wonder if Ribby has taken  pie out of the oven yet?"" said Duchess, ""and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?""",15234_5.gif

158,1,158_1.jpg, Perhaps I ought to explain that she had already known other experiences of a purely imaginative character. Part of her existence had been passed,17168_1.jpg
158,2,158_2.jpg,"I remember that her personation of a certain Mrs. Smith, whose individuality was supposed to be sufficiently represented by a sun-bonnet worn wrong ",17168_2.jpg
158,3,158_3.jpg,"The origin of the title of the Queen of the Pirate Isle, may be briefly stated as follows:—",17168_3.jpg
159,0,159_0.jpg,"An hour after luncheon, one day, Polly, Hickory Hunt, her cousin, and Wan Lee, a Chinese page, were crossing the nursery floor in a Chinese junk. The sea was calm and the sky cloudless. Any change in the weather was as unexpected as it is in books. Suddenly a West Indian Hurricane, purely local in character and unfelt anywhere else, struck Master Hickory and threw him overboard, whence,",17168_4.jpg
159,1,159_1.jpg,It was at this time that it became,17168_5.jpg
159,2,159_2.jpg,"Doubt and scepticism came at last,—and came from Wan Lee! Wan Lee of all creatures! Wan Lee, whose silent, stolid, mechanical performance of a Pirate's duties—a perfect imitation like all his household work—had been their one delight and fascination!It was just after the exciting capture of a mer",17168_6.jpg
159,3,159_3.jpg,"Hickory softly scratched his leg while a broad, bashful smile, almost closed his small eyes. ""Wot!"" he asked.""Mebbee you too frightened to lun away. Melican boy's papa heap lickee.""",17168_7.jpg
160,0,160_0.jpg," The entrance of Polly's mother at this moment put an end to Polly's authority and dispersed the pirate band, but left Wan Lee's proposal and Hickory's rash acceptance ringing in the ears of the Pirate Queen. That evening she was unusually silent. She would have taken Bridget, her nurse, into her confidence, but this would have involved a long explanation of her own feelings, from which, like all imaginative children, she shrank. She, however, made preparation for the proposed flight by settling in her mind which of her two dolls she would take. A wooden creature with easy going knees and moveable hair seemed to be more fit for hard service and any indiscriminate scalping that might turn up hereafter. At supper, she timidly asked a question of Bridget. ""Did ye ever hear the loikes uv that, Ma'am,"" said the Irish handmaid with affectionate pride, ""Shure the darlint's head",17168_8.jpg
160,1,160_1.jpg,"The eventful day dawned without any unusual sign of importance. It was one of the cloudless summer days of the Californian foot hills, bright, dry, and as the morning advanced, hot in the white sunshine. The actual, prosaic house in which the Pirates apparently lived, was a mile from a mining settlement on a beautiful ridge of pine woods sloping gently towards a valley on the one side, and on the other falling abruptly into a dark deep olive gulf of pine trees, rocks, and patches of red soil. Beautiful as the slope was, looking over to the distant snow peaks which seemed to be in another",17168_9.jpg
160,2,160_2.jpg,It was on this ridge that the three children gathered at ten o'clock that morning. An earlier,17168_10.jpg

161,3,161_3.jpg,But a light childish laugh from the clinging little figure seemed to mock them! Then two small heads appeared at the edge of the slide; then a diminutive figure whose feet were apparently held,17168_15.jpg
162,0,162_0.jpg,"Tucking his hands under his blue blouse, Wan Lee suddenly produced from some mysterious recess of his clothing a quantity of red paper slips which he scattered at the entrance of the cavern. Then drawing from the same inexhaustible receptacle certain squibs or fireworks, he let them off and threw them into the opening. There they went off with a slight fizz and splutter, a momentary glittering of small points in the darkness and a strong smell of gunpowder. Polly gazed at the spectacle with undisguised awe and fascination. Hickory and Patsey breathed hard with satisfaction; it was beyond their wildest dreams of mystery and romance. Even Wan Lee appeared transfigured into a superior being by the potency of his own spells. But an unaccountable disturbance of some kind in the dim interior of the tunnel quickly drew the blood from their blanched cheeks again. It was",17168_16.jpg
162,1,162_1.jpg,"""Lady Mary's hair's gone!"" she cried, convulsively grasping the Pirate Hickory's legs.Hickory at once recognised the battered doll under the aristocratic title which Polly had long ago bestowed upon it. He stared at the bald and battered head.""Ha! ha!"" he said, hoarsely; ""skelped by Injins!""",17168_17.jpg
162,2,162_2.jpg,"Thus admonished, the pirates again retired. This time effectively, for worn by actual fatigue or soothed by the delicious coolness of the cave, they gradually, one by one, succumbed to real slumber. Polly withheld from joining them, by official and maternal responsibility sat and blinked at them affectionately.Gradually she, too, felt herself yielding to the",17168_18.jpg
162,3,162_3.jpg,"No! She was a lone widow with nine children, six of whom were already in the lone churchyard on the hill, and the others lying ill with measles and scarlet fever beside her. She had just walked many weary miles that day, and had often begged from door to door for a slice of bread for the starving little ones. It was of no use now—they would die! They would never see their dear mother",17168_19.jpg
163,0,163_0.jpg,"The next thing she remembered was that she was apparently being carried along on some gliding object to the sound of rippling water. She was not alone, for her three companions were lying beside her, rather tightly packed and squeezed in the same mysterious vehicle. Even in the profound darkness that surrounded her, Polly could feel and hear that they were accompanied, and once or twice a faint streak of light from the side of the tunnel showed her gigantic shadows walking slowly on either side of the gliding car. She felt the little hands of her associates seeking hers, and knew they were awake and conscious, and she returned to each a reassuring pressure from the large protecting instinct of her maternal little heart. Presently the car glided into an open space of bright light, and stopped. The transition from the darkness of the tunnel at first dazzled their eyes. It was like a dream.They were in a circular cavern from which three other tunnels like the one they had passed through, diverged. The walls, lit up by fifty or sixty candles stuck at irregular intervals in crevices of the rock,",17168_20.jpg

164,1,164_1.jpg,"""Slipped under his Father's Seat."" p. 30.They went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one another at ten paces apart. The fagot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up sticks to make fagots. Their father and mother, seeing them busy at their work, got away from them unbeknown and then all at once ran as fast as they could through a winding by-path.When the children found they were alone, they began to cry with all their might. Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get home again; for, as he came, he had dropped the little white pebbles he had in his pockets all along the way. Then he said to them, ""Do not be afraid, my brothers,—father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again; only follow me.""They followed, and he brought them home by the very same way they had come into the forest. They dared not go in at first, but stood outside the door to listen to what their father and mother were saying.The very moment the fagot-maker and his wife reached home the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had long owed them, and which they never hoped to see. This gave them new life, for the poor people were dying of hunger. The fagot-maker sent his wife to the butcher's at once. As it was a long while since they had eaten, she bought thrice as much meat as was needed for supper for two people. When they had eaten, the woman said:—""Alas! where are our poor children now? They would make a good feast of what we have left here; it was you, William, who wished to lose them. I told you we should repent of it. What are they now doing in the forest? Alas! perhaps the wolves have already eaten them up; you are very inhuman thus to have lost your children.""The fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated twenty times that he would repent of it, and that she was in the right. He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. The fagot-maker was, perhaps, more sorry than his wife, but she teased him so he could not endure it. She wept bitterly, saying:—",17208_1.jpg
164,2,164_2.jpg,"""If you open it, there's Nothing you may not expect from my Anger."" p. 67.They ceased not to praise and envy the happiness of their friend, who, in the meantime, was not at all amused by looking upon all these rich things, because of her impatience to go and open the closet on the ground floor. Her curiosity was so great that, without considering how uncivil it was to leave her guests, she went down a little back staircase, with such excessive haste that twice or thrice she came near breaking her neck. Having reached the closet-door, she stood still for some time, thinking of her husband's orders, and considering that unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened the door, trembling. At first she could not see anything plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to perceive that several dead women were scattered about the floor. (These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after the other, because they did not obey his orders about the closet on the ground floor.) She thought she surely would die for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she picked up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to compose herself; but she could not rest, so much was she frightened.Having observed that the key of the closet was stained, she tried two or three times to wipe off the stain, but the stain would not come out. In vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand. The stain still remained, for the key was a magic key, and she could never make it quite clean; when the stain was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.Blue Beard returned from his journey that same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the business which called him away was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him she was delighted at his speedy return.Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.""How is it,"" said he, ""that the key of my closet is not among the rest?""",17208_2.jpg
164,3,164_3.jpg,"""With All my Heart, Goody."" p. 75.""Truly,"" cried the mother, ""I must send my own dear child thither. Fanny, look at what comes out of your sister's mouth when she speaks. Would you not be glad, my dear, to have the same gift? You have only to go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a poor woman asks you to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly.""""I should like to see myself going to the fountain to draw water,"" said this ill-bred minx.""I insist you shall go,"" said the mother, ""and that instantly.""She went, but grumbled all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house.She no sooner reached the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood, a magnificently dressed lady, who came up to her, and asked to drink. This was the same fairy who had appeared to her sister, but she had now taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this girl's rudeness would go.""Am I come hither,"" said the proud, ill-bred girl, ""to serve you with water, pray? I suppose this silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship, was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a fancy.""",17208_3.jpg

What that famous blackbird-pie really cost—except in black-birds—is not disclosed, though the King seemed to show some anxiety about the state of his treasury, as he was discovered ""in his counting house"" imediately after the feast. But while the Queen, regardless of expense, regales herself on ""bread and honey"" in ""the parlour"", and her Maid-of-honour, or perhaps of-all-work, is engaged at the clothes-line, nothing is said about a princess.No doubt there was a princess, and that Princess might have been PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE? Anyway here she is in the same boat—I mean book—and certainly her adventures are romantic enough to prevent any surprise at the company in which Her Highness now finds herself.Even princesses cannot do without Alphabets, and so in her train comes AN ALPHABET in which will be discovered many OLD and tried FRIENDS of the Nursery.Thus we launch another volume of our series, like a fairy ship with a rather mixed cargo, in the hope that—to change the metaphor—like the blackbird-pie, it may prove, when opened, to be ""a pretty dish to set before—"" their Babyships.",18344_0.jpg

The boat was soon far out at sea. The waves rose, the rain poured in torrents, and the thunder roared. Feintise could not doubt that the boat would be swamped, and felt relieved by the thought that the poor little innocents would perish, for she would otherwise always be haunted by the fear that something would occur to betray the share she had had in their preservation.But the good Fairy protected them, and after floating at sea for seven days they were picked up by a Corsair. He was so struck by their beauty that he altered his course, and took them home to his wife, who had no children. She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands. They admired together the wonderful stars, the chains of gold that could not be taken off their necks, and their long ringlets. Much greater was the woman's astonishment when she combed them, for at every instant there rolled out of their hair pearls, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. She told her husband of it, who was not less surprised than herself.""I am very tired,"" said he, ""of a Corsair's life, and if the locks of those little children continue to supply us with such treasures, I will give up roaming the seas."" The Corsair's wife, whose name was Corsine, was enchanted at this, and loved the four infants so much the more for it. She named the Princess, Belle-Etoile, her eldest brother, Petit-Soleil, the second, Heureux, and the son of Brunette, Cheri.As they grew older, the Corsair applied himself seriously to their education, as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached to their birth.The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children, who passed for their own. They were exceedingly united, but Prince Cheri entertained for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other two. The moment she expressed a wish for anything, he would attempt even impossibilities to gratify her.One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking. ""When I fell in with them,"" said the Corsair, ""I saw nothing that could give me any idea of their birth."" ""I suspect,"" said Corsine, ""that Cheri is not their brother, he has neither star nor neck-chain."" Belle-Etoile immediately ran and told this to the three Princes, who resolved to speak to the Corsair and his wife, and ask them to let them set out to discover the secret of their birth. After some remonstrance they gained their consent. A beautiful vessel was prepared, and the young Princess and the three Princes set out. They determined to sail to the very spot where the Corsair had found them, and made preparations for a grand sacrifice to the fairies, for their protection and guidance. They were about to immolate a turtle-dove, but the Princess saved its life, and let it fly. At this moment a syren issued from the water, and said, ""Cease your anxiety, let your vessel go where it will; land where it stops."" The vessel now sailed more quickly. Suddenly they came in sight of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter the port. Their wishes were accomplished; they landed, and the shore in a moment was crowded with people, who had observed the magnificence of their ship. They ran and told the King the news, and as the grand terrace of the Palace looked out upon the sea-shore, he speedily repaired thither. The Princes, hearing the people say, ""There is the King,"" looked up, and made a profound obeisance. He looked earnestly at them, and was as much charmed by the Princess's beauty, as by the handsome mien of the young Princes. He ordered his equerry to offer them his protection, and everything that they might require.The King was so interested about these four children, that he went into the chamber of the Queen, his mother, to tell her of the wonderful stars which shone upon their foreheads, and everything that he admired in them. She was thunderstruck at it, and was terribly afraid that Feintise had betrayed her, and sent her secretary to enquire about them. What he told her of their ages confirmed her suspicions. She sent for Feintise, and threatened to kill her. Feintise, half dead with terror, confessed all; but promised, if she spared her, that she would still find means to do away with them. The Queen was appeased; and, indeed, old Feintise did all she could for her own sake. Taking a guitar, she went and sat down opposite the Princess's window, and sang a song which Belle-Etoile thought so pretty that she invited her into her chamber. ""My fair child,"" said Feintise, ""Heaven has made you very lovely, but you yet want one thing—the dancing-water. If I had possessed it, you would not have seen a white hair upon my head, nor a wrinkle on my face. Alas! I knew this secret too late; my charms had already faded."" ""But where shall I find this dancing-water?"" asked Belle-Etoile. ""It is in the luminous forest,"" said Feintise. ""You have three brothers; does not any one of them love you sufficiently to go and fetch some?"" ""My brothers all love me,"" said the Princess, ""but there is one of them who would not refuse me anything."" The perfidious old woman retired, delighted at having been so successful. The Princes, returning from the chase, found Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise. Her anxiety about it was so apparent, that Cheri, who thought of nothing but pleasing her, soon found out the cause of it, and, in spite of her entreaties, he mounted his white horse, and set out in search of the dancing-water. When supper-time arrived, and the Princess did not see her brother Cheri, she could neither eat nor drink; and desired he might be sought for everywhere, and sent messengers to find him and bring him back.",18344_9.jpg
206,2,206_2.jpg,"The wicked Feintise was very anxious to know the result of her advice; and when she heard that Cheri had already set out, she was delighted, and reported to the Queen-Mother all that had passed. ""I admit, Madam,"" said she, ""that I can no longer doubt that they are the same four children: but one of the Princes is already gone to seek the dancing-water, and will no doubt perish in the attempt, and I shall find similar means to do away with all of them.""The plan she had adopted with regard to Prince Cheri was one of the most certain, for the dancing-water was not easily to be obtained; it was so notorious from the misfortunes which occurred to all who sought it, that every one knew the road to it. He was eight days without taking any repose but in the woods. At the end of this period he began to suffer very much from the heat; but it was not the heat of the sun, and he did not know the cause of it, until from the top of a mountain he perceived the luminous forest; all the trees were burning without being consumed, and casting out flames to such a distance that the country around was a dry desert.At this terrible scene he descended, and more than once gave himself up for lost. As he approached this great fire he was ready to die with thirst; and perceiving a spring falling into a marble basin, he alighted from his horse, approached it, and stooped to take up some water in the little golden vase which he had brought with him, when he saw a turtle-dove drowning in the fountain. Cheri took pity on it, and saved it. ""My Lord Cheri,"" she said, ""I am not ungrateful; I can guide you to the dancing-water, which, without me, you could never obtain, as it rises in the middle of the forest, and can only be reached by going underground."" The Dove then flew away, and summoned a number of foxes, badgers, moles, snails, ants, and all sorts of creatures that burrow in the earth. Cheri got off his horse at the entrance of the subterranean passage they made for him, and groped his way after the kind Dove, which safely conducted him to the fountain. The Prince filled his golden vase; and returned the same way he came.He found Belle-Etoile sorrowfully seated under some trees, but when she saw him she was so pleased that she scarcely knew how to welcome him.Old Feintise learned from her spies that Cheri had returned, and that the Princess, having washed her face with the dancing-water, had become more lovely than ever. Finding this, she lost no time in artfully making the Princess sigh for the wonderful singing-apple. Prince Cheri again found her unhappy, and again found out the cause, and once more set out on his white horse, leaving a letter for Belle-Etoile.In the meanwhile, the King did not forget the lovely children, and reproached them for never going to the Palace. They excused themselves by saying that their brother's absence prevented them.Prince Cheri at break of day perceived a handsome young man, from whom he learned where the singing-apple was to be found: but after travelling some time without seeing any sign of it, he saw a poor turtle-dove fall at his feet almost dead. He took pity on it, and restored it, when it said, ""Good-day, handsome Cheri, you are destined to save my life, and I to do you signal service. You are come to seek for the singing-apple: it is guarded by a terrible dragon."" The Dove then led him to a place where he found a suit of armour, all of glass: and by her advice he put it on, and boldly went to meet the dragon. The two-headed monster came bounding along, fire issuing from his throat; but when he saw his alarming figure multiplied in the Prince's mirrors he was frightened in his turn. He stopped, and looking fiercely at the Prince, apparently laden with dragons, he took flight and threw himself into a deep chasm. The Prince then found the tree, which was surrounded with human bones, and breaking off an apple, prepared to return to the Princess. She had never slept during his absence, and ran to meet him eagerly.When the wicked Feintise heard the sweet singing of the apple, her grief was excessive, for instead of doing harm to these lovely children, she only did them good by her perfidious counsels. She allowed some days to pass by without showing herself; and then once more made the Princess unhappy by saying that the dancing-water and the singing-apple were useless without the little green bird that tells everything.",18344_10.jpg
206,3,206_3.jpg,"The time seemed so long to Belle-Etoile, and still no signs of her beloved Cheri, that she fell dangerously ill; and in the hopes of curing her, Petit-Soleil resolved to seek him.But he too was swallowed up by the rock and fell into the great hall. The first person he saw was Cheri, but he could not speak to him; and Prince Heureux, following soon after, met with the same fate as the other two.When Feintise was aware that the third Prince was gone, she was exceedingly delighted at the success of her plan; and when Belle-Etoile, inconsolable at finding not one of her brothers return, reproached herself for their loss, and resolved to follow them, she was quite overjoyed.The Princess was disguised as a cavalier, but had no other armour than her helmet. She was dreadfully cold as she drew near the rock, but seeing a turtle-dove lying on the snow, she took it up, warmed it, and restored it to life: and the dove reviving, gaily said, ""I know you, in spite of your disguise; follow my advice: when you arrive at the rock, remain at the bottom and begin to sing the sweetest song you know; the green bird will listen to you; you must then pretend to go to sleep; when it sees me, it will come down to peck me, and at that moment you will be able to seize it.""All this fell out as the Dove foretold. The green bird begged for liberty. ""First,"" said Belle-Etoile, ""I wish that thou wouldst restore my three brothers to me.""""Under my left wing there is a red feather,"" said the bird: ""pull it out, and touch the rock with it.""The Princess hastened to do as she was instructed; the rock split from the top to the bottom: she entered with a victorious air the hall in which stood the three Princes with many others; she ran towards Cheri, who did not know her in her helmet and male attire, and could neither speak nor move. The green bird then told the Princess she must rub the eyes and mouth of all those she wished to disenchant with the red feather, which good office she did to all.The three Princes and Belle-Etoile hastened to present themselves to the King; and when Belle-Etoile showed her treasures, the little green bird told him that the Princes Petit-Soleil and Heureux and the Princess Belle-Etoile were his children, and that Prince Cheri was his nephew. Queen Blondine, who had mourned for them all these years, embraced them, and the wicked Queen-Mother and old Feintise were justly punished. And the King, who thought his nephew Cheri the handsomest man at Court, consented to his marriage with Belle-Etoile. And lastly, to make everyone happy, the King sent for the Corsair and his wife, who gladly came.",18344_11.jpg

Then the Old Lady thought that they had better take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house. So Peter and Strong-arm put a roof to it, and cut a door, and turned it into a dwelling.

Strong-arm then walked boldly across the court-yard, and presently met a page, who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted. Strong-arm said he had come to liberate his father, who was kept a prisoner by the Giant; on this the little man said he was sorry for him, because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was guarded by a large dragon. Strong-arm, nothing daunted, soon found the monster, who was fast asleep, so he made short work of him by sending his sword right through his heart; at which he jumped up, uttering a loud scream, and made as if he would spring forward and seize Strong-arm; but the good sword had done its work, and the monster fell heavily on the ground, dead.",18937_5.jpg

248,1,248_1.jpg," Now if the children chanced to die,   Ere they to age should come, Their uncle should possess their wealth:   For so the will did run. “Now brother,” said the dying man,   “Look to my children dear; Be good unto my boy and girl,   No friend else have they here.” Their parents being dead and gone,   The children home he takes, And brings them both unto his house,   Where much of them he makes. He had not kept these pretty babes   A twelvemonth and a day, When, for their wealth, he did devise   To make them both away.",18937_9.jpg
248,2,248_2.jpg," He bargain'd with two ruffians bold,   Who were of savage mood, That they should take the children twain,   And slay them in a wood. They prate and prattle pleasantly   While riding on the way, To those their wicked uncle hired,   These lovely babes to slay: So that the pretty speech they had,   Made the ruffians' heart relent; And they that took the deed to do,   Full sorely did repent. Yet one of them, more hard of heart,   Did vow to do his charge, Because the wretch that hired him   Had paid him very large.",18937_10.jpg
248,3,248_3.jpg," The other would not agree thereto,   So here they fell at strife; With one another they did fight,   About the children's life: And he that was of milder mood,   Did slay the other there, Within an unfrequented wood;   The babes did quake for fear! He took the children by the hand,   While they for bread complain: “Stay here,” said he, “I'll bring ye bread,   When I do come again.” These pretty babes, with hand in hand,   Went wandering up and down; But never more they saw the man,   Approaching from the town:",18937_11.jpg

Little Bo-Peep was a very nice little girl. Her cheeks had a bloom on them like a lovely peach, and her voice sounded like a sweet silver bell. But though Little Bo-Peep was as good as she was beautiful, she sometimes met with misfortunes that made her very sad. Once, when she lost her sheep, she was very doleful indeed. And this is how it happened. One summer evening, when the sun was setting, Little Bo-Peep, who had to rise very early in the morning, felt tired, and sat down on a bank covered with daisies. Being very weary she soon fell fast asleep. Now the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was a most stupid and stubborn fellow. I dare say you know that all the sheep in a flock will follow the Bell-wether, and that he always wears a bell round his neck. It was a great pity, but the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was very wild, and was much given to wander far away into the wood, where of course the rest of the sheep would follow him. Finding Little Bo-Peep asleep, the tiresome fellow began by standing on his hind legs and making a great bow to his shadow before him on the grass.

But he only cried “Caw, caw, caw;” so Bo-Peep ran on again across the fields. She wandered on till night-fall, and being faint with hunger, was very glad to see a light just before her. As she went on, she saw that it shone from a cottage window. But when she came to the door, it looked so dark and dismal that she was afraid to go in, and was just going to run away, when a cross-looking old woman came out, and dragged her into the cottage.

But she did not know where to go, and gave herself up for lost, when she heard something cry, “tu-whit—tu-whoo,” in the tree above her. It was a great owl, which began flapping its wings with joy. Bo-Peep was frightened at first, but as the owl seemed very kind, she followed it. It took her to a cottage were there was plenty to eat and drink, and then, to Bo-Peep's great surprise, it began to speak, and told her this story:— “Know, dear Maiden,” said the owl, “that I am the daughter of a King, and was a lovely Princess; but I was changed into an owl by the old woman at the cottage, because I would not marry her ugly son. But I have heard the fairies say that one day a lovely maiden, who would come into this wood to find her lost sheep, should be the means of my gaining my own form again. You are that pretty maid, and I will take you to a spot where you will find your sheep, but without their tails. The elves will play with them for this night, but in the morning every sheep will have its tail again, except the stupid Bell-wether. You must then wave his tail three times over my head, and I shall resume my shape again.” The owl flew off, and led Bo-Peep into the wood, and said, “Sleep, maiden, I will watch.” How long she was asleep she could not tell, but the charmed spot was suddenly lighted up, and she saw the Queen of the Fairies seated on a bank.

This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away, his mother made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she went out to the miller's to buy some flour. But as soon as he was alone, instead of learning his lessons, he began to tease the poor cat. Then he got the bellows, and cut the leather with a knife, so as to see where the wind came from: and when he could not find this out, he began to cry. After this he broke all his brother's toys; he forced the drum-stick through the drum, he tore off the tail from the kite, and then pulled off the horse's head. And then he went to the cupboard and ate the jam. When Mrs. Pig came home, she sat down by the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep.

He left the road, and plunged into the thick of the wood, where he amused himself by leaping with his clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself.

When Jack was left alone, he made the best of his way to the market-place. He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose, for when he got there he was very late, and there was but one left. But as it was a prime one, Jack bought it at once, and keeping to the road, made straight for home.

But this was not so easy to do, for Jack was strong and active; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever, and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. And well did his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she would lay him a golden egg, and Jack, grown wiser, would no longer sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself. His wealth became known to all the country round, and the Squire at length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law.

She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun       to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to       her very earnestly, ""Now, Dinah, my dear, tell me the truth. Did you ever       eat a bat?"" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap of sticks       and shavings, and the fall was over.            Alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked       up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and       the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a       moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and just heard it say,       as it turned a corner, ""my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"" She       turned the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low       hall, lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof.            There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when       Alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the       middle, wondering",19002_2.jpg

However, nothing more happened so she       decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when       she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key,       and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not       possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and       she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was       too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor       little thing sat down and cried.            ""Come! there's no use in crying!"" said Alice to herself rather sharply, ""I       advise you to leave off this minute!"" (she generally gave herself very       good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears       into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been       unkind to herself",19002_3.jpg

(for when she looked down       at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so far       off,) ""oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and       stockings for you now, dears?

Alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the       rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid voice, ""If you please, Sir—""       the rabbit started violently, looked up once into the roof of the hall,       from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay and the       white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could       go.            Alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious       that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—""dear,       dear! how queer everything is today! and yesterday everything happened       just as usual: I wonder if I was changed in the night?

And I       declare it's too bad, it is!""            At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in       salt water. Her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she       remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it was       the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. ""I wish I       hadn't cried so much!"" said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her       way out, ""I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in       my own tears!

""Would it be any use, now,"" thought Alice, ""to speak to this mouse? The       rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been,       ever since I came down here, but that is no reason why the mouse should       not be able to talk. I think I may as well try.""            So she began: ""oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am       very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse!"" The mouse looked at her       rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little       eyes, but it said nothing.            ""Perhaps it doesn't understand English,"" thought Alice; ""I daresay it's a       French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror!"" (for,",19002_7.jpg
256,0,256_0.jpg,"       So she called softly after it: ""mouse dear! Do come back again, and we       won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them!"" When the       mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face was       quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,) and it said in a trembling low       voice ""let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and       you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.""            It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and       animals that had fallen into it. There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and       an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the       whole party swam to the shore.     ",19002_8.jpg

""Hold your tongue, Ma!""       said the young Crab, a little snappishly, ""you're enough to try the       patience of an oyster!""            ""I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!"" said Alice aloud, addressing       no one in particular, ""she'd soon fetch it back!""            ""And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?"" said the Lory.            Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet,       ""Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you       can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll       eat a little bird as soon as look at it!""            This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the       birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very       carefully, remarking ""I really must be getting home: the night air does       not suit my throat,"" and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its       children ""come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!"" On       various pretexts, they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.     ",19002_10.jpg
256,3,256_3.jpg,"       Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet,       ""Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you       can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll       eat a little bird as soon as look at it!""

On       various pretexts, they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.     ",19002_11.jpg
257,0,257_0.jpg,"       By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table       in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as Alice had hoped,) two       or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and       was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle       that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this time with       the words ""drink me,"" but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her       lips: ""I know something interesting is sure to happen,"" she said to       herself, ""whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll see what this bottle       does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm quite tired of being       such a tiny little thing!""            It did so indeed, and much sooner",19002_12.jpg
257,1,257_1.jpg," than she expected: before she had drunk half       the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and she       stooped to save her neck from being broken, and hastily put down the       bottle, saying to herself ""that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't grow       any more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!""            Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had       to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even for this, and she       tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow against the door, and the       other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and as a last       resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney,       and said to herself ""now I can do no more—what ",19002_13.jpg
257,2,257_2.jpg,"       Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,       and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there       seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again, no       wonder she felt unhappy. ""It was much pleasanter at home,"" thought poor       Alice, ""when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being       ordered about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down       that rabbit-hole, and yet, and yet—it's rather curious, you know,       this sort of life. I do wonder what  have       happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of       thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There out to       be a book written about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll       write one—but I'm grown up now"" said she in a sorrowful tone, ""at       least there's no room to grow up any more        ""But then,"" thought Alice, ""shall I ",19002_14.jpg
257,3,257_3.jpg," say to       itself ""then I'll go round and get in at the window.""      you wo'n't!"" thought Alice, and, after       waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window, she       suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not       get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash       of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it       had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.            Next came an angry voice—the rabbit's—""Pat, Pat! where are       you?"" And then a voice she had never heard before, ""shure then I'm here!       digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!""            ""Digging for apples indeed!"" said the rabbit angrily, ""here, come and help       me",19002_15.jpg
258,0,258_0.jpg,"       heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and       scrambling in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself ""this       is Bill,"" she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what would       happen next.            The first thing was a general chorus of ""there goes Bill!"" then the       rabbit's voice alone ""catch him, you by the hedge!"" then silence, and then       another confusion of voices, ""how was it, old fellow? what happened to       you? tell us all about it.""            Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, (""that's Bill"" thought Alice,)       which said ""well, I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster myself—something       comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the next minute up I goes like a       rocket!"" ""And so you did, old fellow!"" said the other voices.",19002_16.jpg
258,1,258_1.jpg,"       ""We must burn the house down!"" said the voice of the rabbit, and Alice       called out as loud as she could ""if you do, I'll set Dinah at you!"" This       caused silence again, and while Alice was thinking ""but how can I get       Dinah here?"" she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller:       very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in       which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once       more three inches high.            She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of       little animals waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels,       and ""Bill"" a little green lizard, that was being supported in the arms of       one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it something out of a       bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but Alice ran       her hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood.     ",19002_17.jpg
258,2,258_2.jpg,"       and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, which was       sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking       not the least notice of her or of anything else.            For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the       caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her.            ""Who are you?"" said the caterpillar.            This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice replied       rather shyly, ""I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least       I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been       changed several times since that.""            ""What do you mean by that?"" said the caterpillar, ""explain yourself!""     , I'm afraid, sir,""",19002_18.jpg
258,3,258_3.jpg,"       This sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again.            ""Keep your temper,"" said the caterpillar.            ""Is that all?"" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.            ""No,"" said the caterpillar.            Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and       perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing.       For some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking, but at       last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and       said ""so you think you're changed, do you?""            ""Yes, sir,"" said Alice, ""I ca'n't remember the things I used to know—I've       tried to say ""How doth the little busy bee"" and it came all different!""            ""Try and repeat ""You are old, father William"","" said the caterpillar.            Alice folded her hands, and began:     ",19002_19.jpg
259,0,259_0.jpg,"""You are old, father William,"" the young man said,""And your hair is exceedingly white:And yet you incessantly stand on your head—Do you think, at your age, it is right?""""In my youth,"" father William replied to his son,But now that I'm perfectly sure I         have none,Why, I do it again and again.""",19002_20.jpg
259,1,259_1.jpg,"""You are old,"" said the youth, ""as I mentioned before,And have grown most uncommonly fat:Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—Pray what is the reason of that?""""In my youth,"" said the sage, as he shook his gray         locks,""I kept all my limbs very supple,By the use of this ointment, five shillings the box—Allow me to sell you a couple.""",19002_21.jpg
259,2,259_2.jpg,"""You are old,"" said the youth, ""and your jaws are too         weakFor anything tougher than suet:Yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the beak—Pray, how did you manage to do it?""""In my youth,"" said the old man, ""I took to the law,And argued each case with my wife,which it gave to my jawHas         lasted the rest of my life.""",19002_22.jpg
259,3,259_3.jpg,"       This time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few       minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off       the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it       went; ""the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk will make you grow       shorter.""     ? the stalk of        ""Of the mushroom,"" said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it       aloud, and in another moment was out of sight.            Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then       picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and       the top in the other.      does the stalk do?"" she said, and nibbled a       little bit of it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her       chin: it had struck her foot!",19002_23.jpg
260,0,260_0.jpg,"       ""Come! my head's free at last!"" said Alice in a tone of delight, which       changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders       were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an immense length of neck,       which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay       far below her.     ",19002_24.jpg
260,1,260_1.jpg," all that green stuff be?"" said Alice,       ""and where  my shoulders got to? And oh! my       poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see you?"" She was moving them about as she       spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little rustling among the       leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was       delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every       direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in bending it down in a       beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she       found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering in,       when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into her       face, and was violently beating her with its wings.            ""Serpent!"" screamed the pigeon.      a serpent!"" said Alice indignantly, ""let       me alone!""",19002_25.jpg
260,2,260_2.jpg,"       at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute or two, and began       talking to herself as usual: ""well! there's half my plan done now! How       puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from       one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again: the next       thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how        that to be done, I wonder?""            Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway       leading right into it. ""That's very curious!"" she thought, ""but       everything's curious today: I may as well go in."" And in she went.            Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little       glass table: ""now, I'll manage better this time"" she said to herself, and       began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led       into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till       she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little       passage: and —she found herself at last       in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool       fountains.     ",19002_26.jpg
260,3,260_3.jpg," the three       gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a       sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.            First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the       three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and feet at the       corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all ornamented with diamonds,       and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the Royal       children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping       merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with       hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, among whom Alice       recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner,       smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.       Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion,       and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF       HEARTS       When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at       her, and ",19002_27.jpg
261,0,261_0.jpg,"on their feet and hands, to make the arches.            The chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her ostrich:       she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its       legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck       straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its head, it        twist itself round, and look up into her       face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out       laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin       again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled       itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was       generally a ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the       hedgehog to, and as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and       walking off to other",19002_28.jpg
261,1,261_1.jpg,"       parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very       difficult game indeed.            The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled       all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the       Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and shouting ""off       with his head!"" of ""off with her head!"" about once in a minute. All those       whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course       had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an       hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the players, except the       King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under sentence of       execution.            Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice ""have you       seen the Mock Turtle?""            ""No,"" said Alice, ""I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.""            ""Come on then,"" said the Queen, ""and it shall tell you its history.""            As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to       the company generally, ""you are all pardoned.""            ""Come, that's a good thing!"" thought Alice, who had felt quite grieved at       the number of",19002_29.jpg
261,2,261_2.jpg,"       executions which the Queen had ordered.            They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if       you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): ""Up, lazy thing!""       said the Queen, ""and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to       hear its history. I must go back and see after some executions I ordered,""       and she walked off, leaving Alice with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite       like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as       safe to stay as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.            The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she       was out of sight: then it chuckled. ""What fun!"" said the Gryphon, half to       itself, half to Alice.      the fun?"" said Alice.     ,"" said the Gryphon; ""it's all her fancy,       that: they never executes nobody, you know: come on!""",19002_30.jpg
261,3,261_3.jpg,"       ""Everybody says 'come on!' here,"" thought Alice as she walked slowly after       the Gryphon; ""I never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!""            They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,       sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came       nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break. She       pitied it deeply: ""what is its sorrow?"" she asked the Gryphon, and the       Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, ""it's all its       fancy, that: it hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!""            So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes       full of tears, but said nothing.            ""This here young lady"" said the Gryphon,",19002_31.jpg
262,0,262_0.jpg,"       ""We called him Tortoise because he taught us,"" said the Mock Turtle       angrily, ""really you are very dull!""            ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,""       added the Gryphon, and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice,       who felt ready to sink into the earth: at last the Gryphon said to the       Mock Turtle, ""get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!"" and the Mock Turtle       went on in these words:            ""You may not have lived much under the sea—"" (""I haven't,"" said       Alice,) ""and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—""       (Alice began to say ""I once tasted—"" but hastily checked herself,       and said ""no, never,"" instead,) ""so you can have no idea what a delightful       thing a Lobster Quadrille is!""            ""No, indeed,"" said Alice, ""what sort of a thing is it?""            ""Why,"" said the Gryphon, ""you form into a line along the sea shore—""            ""Two lines!"" cried the Mock Turtle, ""seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance       twice—""            ""Each with a lobster as partner!"" cried the Gryphon.     ",19002_32.jpg
262,1,262_1.jpg,"       ""Of course,"" the Mock Turtle said, ""advance twice, set to partners—""            ""Change lobsters, and retire in same order—"" interrupted the       Gryphon.            ""Then, you know,"" continued the Mock Turtle, ""you throw the—""            ""The lobsters!"" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.            ""As far out to sea as you can—""            ""Swim after them!"" screamed the Gryphon.            ""Turn a somersault in the sea!"" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly       about.            ""Change lobsters again!"" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice, ""and       then—""            ""That's all,"" said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the       two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time,       sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.            ""It must be a very pretty dance,"" said Alice timidly.            ""Would you like to see a little of it?"" said the Mock Turtle.            ""Very much indeed,"" said Alice.            ""Come, let's try the first figure!"" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon,       ""we can do",19002_33.jpg

""Come on!"" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he hurried       off, without waiting for the end of the song.            ""What trial is it?"" panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only answered       ""come on!"" and ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on       the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:     ""Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,       The King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a       great crowd assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before       the King stood the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll       of parchment in the other.

262,3,262_3.jpg,"       ""Herald! read the accusation!"" said the King.            On this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then       unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:     ""The Queen of Hearts she made some tartsAll on a summer day:The         Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,And         took them quite away!""       ""Now for the evidence,"" said the King, ""and then the sentence.""            ""No!"" said the Queen, ""first the sentence, and then the evidence!""            ""Nonsense!"" cried Alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, ""the idea of       having the sentence first!""            ""Hold your tongue!"" said the Queen.            ""I won't!"" said Alice, ""you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for       you?""            At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon       her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and       found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister,       who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from the       trees on to her face.",19002_35.jpg

So the boat wound slowly along, beneath the bright       summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till       it passed round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no       more.            Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same       little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how       she would keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving heart of       her childhood: and how she would gather around her other little children,       and make  eyes bright and eager with many a       wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little       Alice of long-ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows,       and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own       child-life, and the happy summer days.

She felt that she was dozing off, and had         just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and         was saying to her very earnestly, ""Now, Dinah, my dear, tell me the         truth. Did you ever eat a bat?"" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came         upon a heap of sticks and shavings, and the fall was over.                Alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked         up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,         and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not         a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and just heard it         say, as it turned a corner, ""my ears and whiskers, how late it's         getting!"" She turned the corner after it, and instantly found herself in         a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof.                There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when         Alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down         the middle, wondering",19002_39.jpg
264,0,264_0.jpg," for she         could not remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened         so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor         Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little         golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found         she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through         the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the         table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with         trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.                ""Come! there's no use in crying!"" said Alice to herself rather sharply,         ""I advise you to leave off this minute!"" (she generally gave herself         very good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring         tears into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own ears for         having been unkind to herself",19002_40.jpg
264,1,264_1.jpg,"         ""Curiouser and curiouser!"" cried Alice, (she was so surprised that she         quite forgot how to speak good English,) ""now I'm opening out like the         largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye, feet!"" (for when she looked         down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so         far off,) ""oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes         and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great         deal too far off to bother myself about you: you must manage the best         way you can—but I must be kind to them,"" thought Alice, ""or         perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them         a new pair of boots every Christmas.""                And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it",19002_41.jpg
264,2,264_2.jpg," dried her eyes to see what         was coming. It was the white rabbit coming back again, splendidly         dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in         the other. Alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so         desperate, and as the rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid         voice, ""If you please, Sir—"" the rabbit started violently, looked         up once into the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come,         and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves, and skurried away         into the darkness, as hard as it could go.                Alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious         that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—""dear,         dear! how queer everything is today! and yesterday everything happened         just as usual: I wonder if I was changed in the night? Let me think: was         I the same when I got up this morning? I think I remember",19002_42.jpg
264,3,264_3.jpg," as she hurried back to the         little door, but the little door was locked again, and the little gold         key was lying on the glass table as before, and ""things are worse than         ever!"" thought the poor little girl, ""for I never was as small as this         before, never! And I declare it's too bad, it is!""                At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in         salt water. Her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then         she remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it         was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. ""I wish         I hadn't cried so much!"" said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find         her way out, ""I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being         drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll",19002_43.jpg
265,0,265_0.jpg," be a queer thing, to be         sure! However, every thing is queer today."" Very soon she saw something         splashing about in the pool near her: at first she thought it must be a         walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was         herself, and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in         like herself.                ""Would it be any use, now,"" thought Alice, ""to speak to this mouse? The         rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been,         ever since I came down here, but that is no reason why the mouse should         not be able to talk. I think I may as well try.""                So she began: ""oh Mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am         very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse!"" The mouse looked at her         rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little         eyes, but it said nothing.                ""Perhaps it doesn't understand English,"" thought Alice; ""I daresay it's         a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror!"" (for,",19002_44.jpg
265,1,265_1.jpg,"         So she called softly after it: ""mouse dear! Do come back again, and we         won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them!"" When         the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face         was quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,) and it said in a         trembling low voice ""let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my         history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.""                It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and         animals that had fallen into it. There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and         an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and         the whole party swam to the shore.       ",19002_45.jpg

""I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!"" said Alice aloud, addressing         no one in particular, ""she'd soon fetch it back!""                ""And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?"" said the         Lory.                Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet,         ""Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you         can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the birds!

266,1,266_1.jpg,"         By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table         in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as Alice had hoped,)         two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a pair of         gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a         little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on         it this time with the words ""drink me,"" but nonetheless she uncorked it         and put it to her lips: ""I know something interesting is sure to         happen,"" she said to herself, ""whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll         see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger, for I'm         quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!""                It did so indeed, and much sooner",19002_49.jpg
266,2,266_2.jpg," than she expected: before she had drunk         half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and         she stooped to save her neck from being broken, and hastily put down the         bottle, saying to herself ""that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't         grow any more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!""                Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon         had to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even for this,         and she tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow against the door,         and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and         as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up         the chimney, and said to herself ""now I can do no more—what ",19002_50.jpg
266,3,266_3.jpg,"         Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,         and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there         seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again, no         wonder she felt unhappy. ""It was much pleasanter at home,"" thought poor         Alice, ""when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being         ordered about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down         that rabbit-hole, and yet, and yet—it's rather curious, you know,         this sort of life. I do wonder what  have         happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of         thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There out         to be a book written about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll         write one—but I'm grown up now"" said she in a sorrowful tone, ""at         least there's no room to grow up any more          ""But then,"" thought Alice, ""shall I ",19002_51.jpg
267,0,267_0.jpg,"         say to itself ""then I'll go round and get in at the window.""        you wo'n't!"" thought Alice, and, after         waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window,         she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did         not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a         crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just         possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.                Next came an angry voice—the rabbit's—""Pat, Pat! where are         you?"" And then a voice she had never heard before, ""shure then I'm here!         digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!""                ""Digging for apples indeed!"" said the rabbit angrily, ""here, come and         help me",19002_52.jpg
267,1,267_1.jpg,"         heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching         and scrambling in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself         ""this is Bill,"" she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what         would happen next.                The first thing was a general chorus of ""there goes Bill!"" then the         rabbit's voice alone ""catch him, you by the hedge!"" then silence, and         then another confusion of voices, ""how was it, old fellow? what happened         to you? tell us all about it.""                Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, (""that's Bill"" thought         Alice,) which said ""well, I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster         myself—something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the next         minute up I goes like a rocket!"" ""And so you did, old fellow!"" said the         other voices.",19002_53.jpg
267,2,267_2.jpg,"         ""We must burn the house down!"" said the voice of the rabbit, and Alice         called out as loud as she could ""if you do, I'll set Dinah at you!"" This         caused silence again, and while Alice was thinking ""but how can I get         Dinah here?"" she found to her great delight that she was getting         smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable         position in which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more         she was once more three inches high.                She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd         of little animals waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice,         squirrels, and ""Bill"" a little green lizard, that was being supported in         the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it         something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she         appeared, but Alice ran her hardest, and soon found herself in a thick         wood.       ",19002_54.jpg
267,3,267_3.jpg,"         and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, which         was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and         taking not the least notice of her or of anything else.                For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the         caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly addressed         her.                ""Who are you?"" said the caterpillar.                This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: Alice replied         rather shyly, ""I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at         least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must         have been changed several times since that.""                ""What do you mean by that?"" said the caterpillar, ""explain yourself!""       , I'm afraid, sir,""",19002_55.jpg
268,0,268_0.jpg,"         This sounded promising: Alice turned and came back again.                ""Keep your temper,"" said the caterpillar.                ""Is that all?"" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she         could.                ""No,"" said the caterpillar.                Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and         perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth         hearing. For some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking,         but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth         again, and said ""so you think you're changed, do you?""                ""Yes, sir,"" said Alice, ""I ca'n't remember the things I used to know—I've         tried to say ""How doth the little busy bee"" and it came all different!""                ""Try and repeat ""You are old, father William"","" said the caterpillar.                Alice folded her hands, and began:       ",19002_56.jpg
268,1,268_1.jpg,"""You are old, father William,"" the young man said,""And your hair is exceedingly white:And yet you incessantly stand on your head—Do you think, at your age, it is right?""""In my youth,"" father William replied to his son,But now that I'm perfectly sure I           have none,Why, I do it again and again.""",19002_57.jpg
268,2,268_2.jpg,"""You are old,"" said the youth, ""as I mentioned           before,And have grown most uncommonly           fat:Yet you turned a back-somersault in           at the door—Pray what is the           reason of that?""""In my youth,"" said the sage, as he shook his gray           locks,""I kept all my limbs very supple,By the use of this ointment, five shillings the box—Allow me to sell you a couple.""",19002_58.jpg
268,3,268_3.jpg,"""You are old,"" said the youth, ""and your jaws are too           weakFor anything tougher than suet:Yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the           beak—Pray, how did you manage to           do it?""""In my youth,"" said the old man, ""I took to the law,And argued each case with my wife,which it gave to my jawHas           lasted the rest of my life.""",19002_59.jpg
269,0,269_0.jpg,"         This time Alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few         minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down         off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as         it went; ""the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk will make you         grow shorter.""       ? the stalk of          ""Of the mushroom,"" said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it         aloud, and in another moment was out of sight.                Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and         then picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one         hand, and the top in the other.        does the stalk do?"" she said, and nibbled         a little bit of it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on         her chin: it had struck her foot!",19002_60.jpg
269,1,269_1.jpg,"         ""Come! my head's free at last!"" said Alice in a tone of delight, which         changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders         were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an immense length of neck,         which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay         far below her.       ",19002_61.jpg
269,2,269_2.jpg," all that green stuff be?"" said Alice,         ""and where  my shoulders got to? And oh! my         poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see you?"" She was moving them about as         she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little rustling         among the leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands,         and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every         direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in bending it down in         a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which         she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering         in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into         her face, and was violently beating her with its wings.                ""Serpent!"" screamed the pigeon.        a serpent!"" said Alice indignantly, ""let         me alone!""",19002_62.jpg
269,3,269_3.jpg,"         at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute or two, and began         talking to herself as usual: ""well! there's half my plan done now! How         puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be,         from one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again:         the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how  that to be done, I wonder?""                Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway         leading right into it. ""That's very curious!"" she thought, ""but         everything's curious today: I may as well go in."" And in she went.                Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little         glass table: ""now, I'll manage better this time"" she said to herself,         and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that         led into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom         till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little         passage: and —she found herself at last         in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool         fountains.       ",19002_63.jpg
270,0,270_0.jpg,"         the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.         There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to         see the Queen.                First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the         three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and feet at the         corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all ornamented with         diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came         the Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came         jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all         ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly kings and queens,         among whom Alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a         hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by         without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the         King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand procession, came         THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS         When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked         at her, and ",19002_64.jpg
270,1,270_1.jpg,"on their feet and hands, to make the         arches.                The chief difficulty which Alice found at first was to manage her         ostrich: she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her         arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its         neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its         head, it  twist itself round, and look up         into her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help         bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going         to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had         unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,         there was generally a ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted         to send the hedgehog to, and as the doubled-up soldiers were always         getting up and walking off to other",19002_65.jpg
270,2,270_2.jpg," parts of the ground, Alice         soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.                The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled         all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the         Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and shouting         ""off with his head!"" of ""off with her head!"" about once in a minute. All         those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of         course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of         half an hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the players,         except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody, and under         sentence of execution.                Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice ""have         you seen the Mock Turtle?""                ""No,"" said Alice, ""I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.""                ""Come on then,"" said the Queen, ""and it shall tell you its history.""                As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to         the company generally, ""you are all pardoned.""                ""Come, that's a good thing!"" thought Alice, who had felt quite grieved         at the number of",19002_66.jpg
270,3,270_3.jpg,"         executions which the Queen had ordered.                They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun:         (if you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): ""Up, lazy         thing!"" said the Queen, ""and take this young lady to see the Mock         Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and see after some         executions I ordered,"" and she walked off, leaving Alice with the         Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the         whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage         Queen: so she waited.                The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till         she was out of sight: then it chuckled. ""What fun!"" said the Gryphon,         half to itself, half to Alice.        the fun?"" said Alice.       ,"" said the Gryphon; ""it's all her         fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know: come on!""",19002_67.jpg
271,0,271_0.jpg,"         ""Everybody says 'come on!' here,"" thought Alice as she walked slowly         after the Gryphon; ""I never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!""                They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,         sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came         nearer, Alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break. She         pitied it deeply: ""what is its sorrow?"" she asked the Gryphon, and the         Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, ""it's all its         fancy, that: it hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!""                So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes         full of tears, but said nothing.                ""This here young lady"" said the Gryphon,",19002_68.jpg
271,1,271_1.jpg,"         ""We called him Tortoise because he taught us,"" said the Mock Turtle         angrily, ""really you are very dull!""                ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,""         added the Gryphon, and then they both sat silent and looked at poor         Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth: at last the Gryphon said         to the Mock Turtle, ""get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!"" and the Mock         Turtle went on in these words:                ""You may not have lived much under the sea—"" (""I haven't,"" said         Alice,) ""and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—""         (Alice began to say ""I once tasted—"" but hastily checked herself,         and said ""no, never,"" instead,) ""so you can have no idea what a         delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!""                ""No, indeed,"" said Alice, ""what sort of a thing is it?""                ""Why,"" said the Gryphon, ""you form into a line along the sea shore—""                ""Two lines!"" cried the Mock Turtle, ""seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance         twice—""                ""Each with a lobster as partner!"" cried the Gryphon.       ",19002_69.jpg
271,2,271_2.jpg,"         ""Of course,"" the Mock Turtle said, ""advance twice, set to partners—""                ""Change lobsters, and retire in same order—"" interrupted the         Gryphon.                ""Then, you know,"" continued the Mock Turtle, ""you throw the—""                ""The lobsters!"" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.                ""As far out to sea as you can—""                ""Swim after them!"" screamed the Gryphon.                ""Turn a somersault in the sea!"" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly         about.                ""Change lobsters again!"" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice,         ""and then—""                ""That's all,"" said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the         two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time,         sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.                ""It must be a very pretty dance,"" said Alice timidly.                ""Would you like to see a little of it?"" said the Mock Turtle.                ""Very much indeed,"" said Alice.                ""Come, let's try the first figure!"" said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon,         ""we can do",19002_70.jpg
271,3,271_3.jpg," the Mock Turtle had just         begun to repeat it, when a cry of ""the trial's beginning!"" was heard in         the distance.                ""Come on!"" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, he hurried         off, without waiting for the end of the song.                ""What trial is it?"" panted Alice as she ran, but the Gryphon only         answered ""come on!"" and ran the faster, and more and more faintly came,         borne on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:       ""Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,         The King and Queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a         great crowd assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before         the King stood the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a         scroll of parchment in the other.

280,2,280_2.jpg,"Then, also, there were little skirts, and tiny stockings, and pretty little shoes with shiny buckles and real heels, and there was a pink parasol, and, best of all, a dear little muff, made of soft white fur, to keep Big Mary's hands warm in cold weather.At first little Marian loved to dress Big Mary in all these pretty things, and she would put on first the warm red dress, and then the thin white one, and then the one of blue silk with the beautiful lace. And she would raise the big parasol and put it over Big Mary's head. But she hardly ever gave Big Mary the little white muff to hold, because that was for very,  best. Little Marian's own mamma had said so. But when Marian's birthday came, grandma gave her a doll's trunk, and after that the days were not so pleasant for Big Mary. It was so much fun to pack the trunk that little Marian often took off all the clothes Big Mary had on to put them away in the trunk. Many a time poor Big Mary had to sit for hours all undressed, and she would shiver and shake, until at last one time when little Marian had left her lying all night on the floor without any clothes on, she took a dreadful cold and became very ill.Then little Marian was very sorry for what she had done, and she put Big Mary to bed and sent for Dr. Prince. When the doctor came he looked at Big Mary's tongue, and felt her pulse. And then he shook his head and looked very grave. He said that Big Mary must take some medicine every day, and must sit out in the fresh air, and always wear her best clothes all the time; for she was a very sick doll indeed. So little Marian dressed Big Mary in the blue silk trimmed with lace, because that was her very best dress, and she raised the pink parasol and put it over her head and she gave Big Mary the white muff to hold, because that was for very,  best. Then she carried Big Mary out to the gray rock in the back yard where the nasturtiums grow, to sit in the fresh air all day long.Now little Miss Freckle Frog lived under the big rock. She was ugly, as all frogs are, but she loved pretty things, perhaps because she was not pretty herself. But although she was not pretty, she was a kind-hearted little body, and all her friends liked her.Every day when Big Mary sat in the sunshine, Freckle Frog crept out from under the rock, and hid in the grass, and watched her. She thought Big Mary was wonderful, but she thought that the blue silk dress and the pink parasol were more wonderful still, and the little soft muff,—that was the most wonderful of all! And poor little Freckle Frog wished that she had a blue silk dress with lace, and a pink parasol like Big Mary. But most of all she wished that she had a little soft muff.Now it happened, too, that it was just about the time for Mr. Robin Redbreast to give his big party in the orchard, and little Freckle Frog had been invited, and more than that, her own cousin, Billy Bullfrog, had promised to sing, and of course she wished to look just as nice as she could.So early one fine day, she went to see the Morning Glory Ladies who live near the back porch and always wear such beautiful dresses, and she said to them:""Oh, dear Morning Glory Ladies, your dresses are always so beautiful! But have you seen Big Mary's blue silk trimmed with lace? It is more beautiful still, the loveliest dress in the whole world! Would you mind making me one like that to wear to Robin Redbreast's party? My cousin, Billy Bullfrog, is to sing, and I wish so very much to look just as nice as I can. I am not one bit pretty like Big Mary, but clothes always help a great deal, you know. Would you mind lending me one for the party?""",19197_2.jpg

She almost cried about it. But just then Little Black Spider, who was a good friend of hers, peeped out from under a leaf and said:""I wouldn't mind them. They are a conceited lot anyway. It is a hot day, too, and they are apt to be cross on hot days. I will spin you all the lace you want.""And so he did. He wove it all that day in his web, and the next morning he brought her a long piece of the loveliest spider-lace as fine as a cobweb. Little Freckle Frog was very grateful to him.",19197_3.jpg

It kept the rain off of me the other day, and it is just as soft and pink as Big Mary's parasol.""So she showed Freckle Frog where to find the mushroom, and it was very soft and pink, just as she had said, and Freckle Frog was very happy about it.""Now if I only had a muff,"" she sighed, ""I could look just as beautiful as Big Mary at the party!""Just then there was a great noise in the tree near the rock and Robin Redbreast himself flew out from among the leaves, but right at her feet dropped a little white caterpillar. He was so frightened that he curled himself up into a ball and lay very still. He made Big Mary laugh, but Freckle Frog had a bright idea.",19197_4.jpg

""Would you mind if I wear you to the party just this once?""The poor little caterpillar uncurled himself.""If you will promise to take care of me and not let Robin Redbreast eat me,"" he answered, ""I shall be only too glad to be your muff.""So Freckle Frog went to the party and wore the cobweb lace, and carried the mushroom parasol, and held the soft little white caterpillar for a muff. She even bought a sweet-pea bonnet to please the Morning Glory Ladies.Then Robin Redbreast said she looked better than anybody else at his party, and Big Mary, who was well enough by that time to go also, said so, too.",19197_5.jpg

He himself was always in better voice then, he said, and so he felt sure that Billy Bullfrog and all the other singers must be, too. Then the world was lovelier at that time than it was through the long, hot day, when sensible people like birds and frogs, and sometimes even babies and dolls, took naps and did not stir out at all. At twilight one could always depend upon the sky to grow very soft and pink, and the fairies never failed to hang the leaves with dewdrops, all to make his parties beautiful! The cherries tasted better then, too, and later still, when it began to grow dark, the katy-dids would play if any one cared to dance. So Robin Redbreast always gave beautiful parties, but even he had never given so beautiful a one before.Little Freckle Frog was very happy. Every one admired her beautiful lace, and she told them all how kind Little Black Spider had been. And by and by, when it came to be time for refreshments, she ate a whole cherry. She never had tasted one before, but as she told Mr. Sparrow, who had brought it to her, she really never had dreamed how delicious a big red cherry could be. Then, when the katy-dids began to play, she danced with her cousin, Billy Bullfrog, until it was time to go home.",19197_6.jpg

For Little Freckle Frog wanted to be friendly with everybody.But at last another idea came into her head. She would give a party herself, just as beautiful a one as Robin Redbreast's, and have it early in the morning so that the Morning Glory Ladies could come.",19197_7.jpg

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org  Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.  *** END: FULL LICENSE ***    ",19537_11.jpg

289,1,289_1.jpg," time ago in a cottage on the edge of a great forest there dwelt a little girl by the name of Golden Hair; she was an orphan and lived with her grandmother who loved her dearly. The grandmother was very old and so most of the house work was done by Golden Hair; but she was so young and strong she did not mind that a bit, for she had plenty of time to play and was merry the whole day long.Although little Golden Hair lived far from other children she was never lonesome, for she had many friends and playmates in the wild creatures of the wood. The gentle, soft eyed deer would feed from her hand, and the wild birds would come at her musical call; for she knew their language and loved them well.Golden Hair had never wandered far into the forest. But one day in the early autumn time, as she was gathering bright leaves and golden rod, she strayed farther than she knew and came upon a lonely, gray cabin under the mighty trees. A slab of wood beside the half open door told who lived within. It read:""Papa Bear, Mamma Bear, and the Tiny Bear.""",19772_1.jpg

293,3,293_3.jpg,"The lank lawyer wagged my hand of a morning, and said, ""And how is Miss Eliza's little beau?""""And how's the new missis this morning, Mr. Smith?"" asked the housekeeper, with a bitterness not softened by the prospect of possible dethronement.""Another try for the tea-tray, ma'am,"" replied Smith, ""but it's no go.""""A brazen, black-haired old maid!"" cried the housekeeper. ""To think of her taking the place of that sweet angel, Mrs. Dacre (and she barely two years in her grave), and pretending to act a mother's part by the poor boy and all. I've no patience!""On one excuse or another, the Burtons contrived to extend their visit; and the prospect of a marriage between my father and Miss Burton was now discussed too openly behind his back for me to fail to hear it. Then Nurse Bundle on this subject hardly exercised her usual discretion in withholding me from servants' gossip, and servants' gossip from me. Her own indignation was strongly aroused, and I had no difficulty in connecting her tearful embraces, and her allusions to my dead mother, with the misfortune we all believed to be impending.At first I had admired Miss Burton's bouncing looks. Then my head had been turned to some extent by her flattery, and by the establishment of that most objectionable of domestic jokes, the parody of love affairs in connection with children. Miss Burton called me her little sweetheart, and sent me messages, and vowed that I was quite a little man of the world, and then was sure that I was a desperate flirt. The lank lawyer wagged my hand of a morning, and said, ""And how is ",19859_3.jpg

294,1,294_1.jpg,"""Mr. Buckle, I believe?""""You'll be staying at the 'Crown' the night, mem?""""No, sir. We stop here,"" said Nurse Bundle.I caught his keen blue eye at the window whilst the coach was delayed by the getting out of our luggage. I do not think he missed one feature of our welcome on the threshold of the saddler's shop.I feel sure that Scotchmen do greatly profit by the habit they have of ""absorbing into their constitutions,"" so to speak, all the facts of every kind that come within their ken. They ""go in for general information,"" like the Tom Toddy in Mr. Kingsley's 'Water Babies;' but their hard heads have, fortunately, no likeness to turnips.This, however, is a digression.Mr. Benjamin Buckle, Mrs. Benjamin Buckle, Jemima Buckle, their daughter, Mr. Buckle's apprentice, and the ""general girl,"" or maid-of-all-work, were all in the shop to receive us. I believe the cat was the only living creature in the house who was not there. But cats seldom exert themselves unnecessarily on behalf of other people, and she awaited our arrival upstairs. I had a severe if not undignified struggle with the string before I could get my hat off. Then I advanced, and, holding out my hand to Mr. Buckle, said,""Mr. Buckle, I believe?""",19859_5.jpg
294,2,294_2.jpg,"She rolled abruptly over on her seat and scrambled off backwards.Hereupon the shopman produced a drawer from below the counter, and set it before them. What it contained I was not tall enough to see, but out of it he took several tiny flat irons of triangular shape, and apparently made of pewter, or some alloy of tin. These the grey beaver examined and tried upon a corner of her cape with inimitable gravity and importance. At last she selected two, and keeping one for herself, gave the other to her sister.""Is it a nice one?"" the little white-beavered lady inquired. as nice as yours?"" she persisted.""Just the same,"" said the other, firmly. And having glanced at the corner to see that the farthings were both duly deposited, she rolled abruptly over on her seat, and scrambled off backwards, a manœuvre which the other child accomplished with more difficulty. The coats and capes were then put tidy as before, and the two went out of the shop together hand in hand.Then the old man-servant lifted them into the Spanish saddle, and buckled the strap, and away they went up the steep street, and over the brow of the hill, where trees and palings began to show, the beaver bonnets nodding together in consultation over the flat irons.",19859_6.jpg
294,3,294_3.jpg,"Polly and Regie in the ""Pulpit"" and the ""Pew"".We were not allowed to climb trees on Sunday, which was a severe exercise of Polly's principles. One Sunday afternoon, however, much to my amazement, she led me away down the shrubbery, saying,""My dear Regie! I've found two trees which I'm sure we may climb on Sundays."" Much puzzled, I nevertheless yielded to her, being quite accustomed to trust all her proceedings.I was not enlightened by the appearance of the trees, which were very much like others as to their ladder-like peculiarities. They were old Portugal laurels which had been cut in a good deal at various times. They looked very easy to climb, and did not seem to boast many ""stories."" I did not see anything about them adapted for Sunday amusement in particular.But Polly soon explained herself.""Look here, Regie,"" said she; ""this tree has got three beautiful branches, one for the clerk, one for the reading-desk, and one for the pulpit. I'm going to get into the top one and preach you a sermon; and you're to sit in that other tree—it makes a capital pew. I'm sure it's quite a Sunday game,"" added Polly, mounting to the pulpit with her accustomed energy.I seated myself in the other tree; and Polly, after consuming some time in ""settling herself,"" appeared to be ready; but she still hesitated, and finally burst out laughing.",19859_7.jpg

303,0,303_0.jpg,"THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGEAt Christmas Jessie had a pretty French doll given to her by her aunt Amy. For weeks Jessie thought she had nothing more to wish for, but in the spring, however, when the days were warm and sunny, and nature called her out-of-doors, she found it rather inconvenient to take her dolly with her every time. She couldn't use her arms for anything else, you see, and like every other child, she liked to run and jump, and pick flowers and other things that caught her eye. But, like a good little mother, she thought her dolly needed the fresh air quite as much as herself; so one night, at the supper-table, she said: ""I wish I had a carriage for Bella, then I could leave her in that when I went for buttercups and violets.""Papa was present, and he heard her remark. In a few days Jessie's birthday would come, and both he and her mamma had been thinking of what they would give her then; for Jessie was such a good, gentle child, seldom teasing for what she could not have, that they always took especial care to remember her on such holidays.The innocent hint was just what he wanted. So on the birthday morn, Jessie found Bella seated in a beautiful little carriage, close beside her chair at the breakfast-table. You may be sure she was a very happy little girl then, and that she gave mamma and papa many loving hugs and kisses for their thoughtfulness and love.",20017_4.jpg

I mean to make cake this morn-ing and I shall want four or five,"" said Mrs. Brown to her lit-tle daugh-ter, An-nie, who had been help-ing her moth-er in the kit-chen work.Hunt-ing for hen's eggs was great fun for the chil-dren at Brown Farm. Some-times two of them would go out to-geth-er, and each would try to get more eggs than the oth-er, and be the first to reach the kit-chen with a cap or hat full.An-nie placed a short light lad-der a-gainst a high beam in the barn, climbed up and just as she reached the top, her bright eyes peep-ing in through the hay piled up on the barn-loft floor, she saw a nice hol-low place, some-thing like a small cave, where one wise bid-dy had scratched out a co-sy nest for her-self, and laid some five large eggs. The hen had gone out for a walk or for a lunch-eon, so An-nie took four of the eggs, put them in-to the crown of her hat, and hast-ened back to give them to her moth-er.""May I not beat them up for you, with the whirl-i-gig beat-er, moth-er, it is so much fun?""""Yes, you may, An-nie, and it will be quite a help to me.""So on through the morn-ing the lit-tle girl found man-y a use-ful and plea-sant thing to do. When the work was all done and an out-ing had been planned for the af-ter-noon, Mrs. Brown said to An-nie, ""This lit-tle verse comes to my mind. I think one of my old-er chil-dren once learned it at school. It is,""Work while you work,Play while you play,That is the wayTo be hap-py and gay.",20017_33.jpg

Her mother took a baby's nurse-bottle and filled it with sweet new milk and in a very short time Lambkin could take, through the rubber tube, all the milk his kind friends would give him.Maude and her pet made a pretty picture playing together in the meadow.Nora, who worked in the kitchen, used to sing an odd little song, some of the words being,""Little lamb, little lamb,Will you leave your old damAnd sit with me by the nursery fire?You shall have bread and milk,And a cushion of silk,",20017_44.jpg

These she brought into the house, and breaking them into a bowl, began to beat them up quickly. Next she took a yellow dish from the dresser and put into it one cup of butter and two cups of sugar. For a long time she mixed these two together until they were ""all one,"" as she called it.Next she put the four beaten eggs into the bowl with the butter and sugar, and beat them until her little hands ached. Then she measured out three cups of flour and sifted it into another dish. With this she put two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and then sifted flour and baking powder together. After this was done, she added a little of it at a time to the mixture of butter and eggs, beating away until all the flour had been used up. Then she put into it a teaspoonful of vanilla essence and added enough milk to make a thick batter. Little pans shaped like hearts and rounds, and one large round pan were then well greased, and the beaten up cake put into each pan until it was half full. Then the pans of cake were set into the oven and in ten or fifteen minutes all the tiny ""hearts and rounds"" were baked a light brown, while the large pan had to stay baking ten or fifteen minutes more.A very happy child was young Ruth when she took out her pans of cake.Her father, mother, brothers and the ""company"" who arrived the next day thought it the ""nicest cake ever made by so young a little girl.""",20017_47.jpg

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain ""Defects,"" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the ""Right of Replacement or Refund"" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.

If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.  1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email business@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official page at http://pglaf.org  For additional contact information:      Dr. Gregory B. Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

There is a tone of solemn and sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality, and lifts the spirit to a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment. The services of the church about this season are extremely tender and inspiring. They dwell on the beautiful story of the origin of our faith, and the pastoral scenes that accompanied its announcement. They gradually increase in fervour and pathos during the season of Advent, until they break forth in full jubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men.

It is inspiring to read even the dry details which some antiquarians have given of the quaint humours, the burlesque pageants, the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship, with which this festival was celebrated. It seemed to throw open every door, and unlock every heart. It brought the peasant and the peer together, and blended all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness.

It is gratifying to see that home-feeling completely aroused which seems to hold so powerful a place in every English bosom. The preparations making on every side for the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred; the presents of good cheer passing and repassing, those tokens of regard, and quickeners of kind feelings; the evergreens distributed about houses and churches, emblems of peace and gladness; all these have the most pleasing effect in producing fond associations, and kindling benevolent sympathies. Even the sound of the waits, rude as may be their minstrelsy, breaks upon the mid-watches of a winter night with the effect of perfect harmony.

It is, indeed, the season of regenerated feeling—the season for kindling, not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall, but the genial flame of charity in the heart.The scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile waste of years; and the idea of home, fraught with the fragrance of home-dwelling joys, re-animates the drooping spirit,—as the Arabian breeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the weary pilgrim of the desert.Stranger and sojourner as I am in the land—though for me no social hearth may blaze, no",20656_13.jpg

Game, poultry, and other luxuries of the table, were in brisk circulation in the villages; the grocers', butchers', and fruiterers' shops were thronged with customers. The housewives were stirring briskly about, putting their dwellings in order; and the glossy branches of holly, with their bright red berries, began to appear at the windows. The scene brought to mind an old writer's account of Christmas preparations:—""Now capons and hens, besides turkeys, geese, and ducks, with beef and mutton—must all die; for in twelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little.

It was of spacious dimensions, hung round with copper and tin vessels highly polished, and decorated here and there with a Christmas green.

He even regrets sometimes that he had not been born a few centuries earlier, when England was itself, and had its peculiar manners and customs. As he lives at some distance from the main road, in rather a lonely part of the country, without any rival gentry near him, he has that most enviable of all blessings to an Englishman, an opportunity of indulging the bent of his own humour without molestation. Being representative of the oldest family in the neighbourhood, and a great part of the peasantry being his tenants, he is much looked up to, and, in general, is known simply by the appellation of 'The Squire;' a title which has been accorded to the head of the family since time immemorial. I think it best to give you these hints about my worthy old father, to prepare you for any little eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd.""We had passed for some time along the wall",20656_27.jpg

I feel a degree of filial reverence for them, as we look up to those who have cherished us in childhood. My father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays, and having us around him on family festivals. He used to direct and superintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the studies of their children. He was very particular that we should play the old English games according to their original form; and consulted old books for precedent and authority for every 'merrie disport;' yet I assure you there never was pedantry so delightful. It was the policy of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the happiest place in the world; and I value this delicious home-feeling as one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow.""We were interrupted by the clangour of a troop of dogs of all sorts and sizes, ""mongrel,",20656_29.jpg

It was an irregular building of some magnitude, and seemed to be of the architecture of different periods. One wing was evidently very ancient, with heavy stone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy, from among the foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass glittered with the moonbeams. The rest of the house was in the French taste of Charles the Second's time, having been repaired and altered, as my friend told me, by one of his ancestors, who returned with that monarch at the Restoration. The grounds about the house were laid out in the old formal manner of artificial flower-beds, clipped shrubberies, raised terraces,",20656_30.jpg

The Squire was a fine, healthy-looking old gentleman, with silver hair curling lightly round an open florid countenance; in which a physiognomist, with the advantage, like myself, of a previous hint or two, might discover a singular mixture of whim and benevolence.""The company, which was assembled in a large old-fashioned hall.""—The family meeting was warm and affectionate; as the evening was far advanced, the Squire would not permit us to change our travelling dresses, but ushered us at once to the company, which was assembled in a large old-fashioned hall. It was composed of different branches of a numerous family connection, where there were the usual proportion of old uncles and aunts, comfortably married dames, superannuated spinsters, blooming country cousins, half-fledged striplings, and bright-eyed boarding-school hoydens.",20656_32.jpg
342,1,342_1.jpg," They were variously occupied; some at a round game of cards; others conversing around the fireplace; at one end of the hall was a group of the young folks, some nearly grown up, others of a more tender and budding age, fully engrossed by a merry game; and a profusion of wooden horses, penny trumpets, and tattered dolls, about the floor, showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings, who having frolicked through a happy day, had been carried off to slumber through a peaceful night.",20656_33.jpg
342,2,342_2.jpg,"While the mutual greetings were going on between Bracebridge and his relatives, I had time to scan the apartment. I have called it a hall, for so it had certainly been in old times, and the Squire had evidently endeavoured to restore it to something of its primitive state. Over the heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior in armour, standing by a white horse, and on the opposite wall hung helmet, buckler, and lance. At one end an enormous pair of antlers were inserted in the wall, the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend hats, whips, and spurs; and in the corners of the apartment were fowling-pieces, fishing-rods, and other sporting implements. The furniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days, though some articles of modern convenience had been added, and the oaken floor had been carpeted; so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlour and hall.",20656_34.jpg

There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described, but is immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his ease. I had not been seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy cavalier before I found myself as much at home as if I had been one of the family.Supper was announced shortly after our arrival. It was served up in a spacious oaken chamber, the panels of which shone with wax, and around which were several family portraits decorated with holly and ivy. Beside the accustomed lights, two great wax tapers, called Christmas candles, wreathed with greens, were placed on a highly-polished buffet among the family plate. The table was abundantly spread with substantial fare; but the Squire made his supper of frumenty, a dish made of wheat cakes",20656_36.jpg

He was a tight, brisk little man, with the air of an arrant old bachelor. His nose was shaped like the bill of a parrot; his face slightly pitted with the small-pox, with a dry perpetual bloom on it, like a frost-bitten leaf in autumn. He had an eye of great quickness and vivacity, with a drollery and lurking waggery of expression that was irresistible. He was evidently the wit of the family, dealing very much in",20656_37.jpg
343,2,343_2.jpg,"plishments in their eyes. He could imitate Punch and Judy; make an old woman of his hand, with the assistance of a burnt cork and pocket-handkerchief; and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature, that the young folks were ready to die with laughing.I was let briefly into his history by Frank Bracebridge. He was an old bachelor of a small independent income, which by careful management was sufficient for all his wants. He revolved through the family system like a vagrant comet in its orbit; sometimes visiting one branch, and sometimes another quite remote; as is often the case with gentlemen of extensive connections and small fortunes in England. He had a chirping, buoyant disposition, always enjoying the present moment; and his frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those rusty unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so uncharitably charged. He was a complete family chronicle, being versed in the genealogy, history,",20656_38.jpg

The most interesting couple in the dance was the young officer and a ward of the Squire's, a beautiful blushing girl of seventeen. From several shy glances which I had noticed in the course of the evening, I suspected there was a little kindness growing up between them; and, indeed, the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a romantic girl. He was tall, slender, and handsome, and, like most young British officers of late years, had picked up various small accomplishments on the Continent—he could talk French and Italian—draw landscapes, sing very tolerably—dance divinely; but, above all, he had been wounded at Waterloo:—what girl of seventeen, well read in poetry and romance, could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection!The moment the dance was over, he caught up a guitar, and lolling against the old marble fireplace, in an attitude which I am half inclined",20656_42.jpg

Her face was suffused, it is true, with a beautiful blush, and there was a gentle heaving of the bosom, but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise of the dance; indeed, so great was her indifference, that she was amusing herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hothouse flowers, and by the time the song was concluded, the nosegay lay in ruins on the floor.The party now broke up for the night with the kind-hearted old custom of shaking hands. As I passed through the hall, on the way to my chamber, the dying embers of the  still sent forth a dusky glow; and had it not been the season when ""no spirit dares stir abroad,"" I should have been half tempted to steal from my room at midnight, and peep whether the fairies might not be at their revels about the hearth.""Indeed, so great was her indifference, that she was amusing herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house flowers.""—",20656_43.png

345,2,345_2.png," pattering outside of the door, and a whispering consultation. Presently a choir of small voices chanted forth an old Christmas carol, the burden of which was,Rejoice, our Saviour he was bornOn Christmas Day in the morning.I rose softly, slipped on my clothes, opened the",20656_46.png
345,3,345_3.jpg," door suddenly, and beheld one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter could imagine. It consisted of a boy and two girls, the eldest not more than six, and lovely as seraphs. They were going the rounds of the house, and singing at every chamber-door; but my sudden appearance frightened them into mute bashfulness. They remained for a moment playing on their lips with their fingers, and now and then stealing a shy glance, from under their eyebrows, until, as if by one impulse, they scampered away, and as they turned an angle of the gallery, I heard them laughing in triumph at their escape.Everything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this stronghold of old-fashioned hospitality. The window of my chamber looked out upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape. There was a sloping lawn, a fine stream winding at the foot of it, and a tract of park beyond, with noble clumps of trees, and herds of deer. At a distance was a neat hamlet,",20656_47.jpg

A robin, perched upon the top of a mountain-ash that hung its clusters of red berries just before my window, was basking himself in the sunshine, and piping a few querulous notes; and a peacock was displaying all the glories of his train, and strutting with the pride and gravity of a Spanish grandee on the terrace-walk below.I had scarcely dressed myself, when a servant appeared to invite me to family prayers. He showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing of the house, where I found the principal part of the family already assembled in a kind of gallery, furnished with cushions, hassocks, and large prayer-books; the servants were seated on benches below. The old gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery, and Master Simon acted as clerk,",20656_48.jpg

We were escorted by a number of gentlemen-like dogs, that seemed loungers about the establishment; from the frisking spaniel to the steady old stag-hound; the last of which was",20656_49.jpg
346,2,346_2.jpg," of a race that had been in the family time out of mind: they were all obedient to a dog-whistle which hung to Master Simon's button-hole, and in the midst of their gambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried in his hand.",20656_50.jpg

But at the fall of the leaf, when his tail falleth, he will mourn and hide himself in corners, till his tail come again as it was.""I could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so whimsical a subject; but I found that the peacocks were birds of some consequence at the hall, for Frank Bracebridge informed me that they were great favourites with his father, who was extremely careful to keep up the breed; partly because they belonged to chivalry, and were in great request at the stately banquets of the olden time; and partly because they had a pomp and magnificence about them, highly becoming an old family mansion. Nothing, he was accustomed to say, had an air of greater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone balustrade.Master Simon had now to hurry off, having an appointment at the parish church with the",20656_51.jpg

347,1,347_1.jpg," fine and clear, the most of the family walked to the church, which was a very old building of gray stone, and stood near a village, about half-a-mile from the park gate. Adjoining it was a low snug parsonage, which seemed coeval with the church. The front of it was perfectly matted with a yew-tree that had been trained against its walls, through the dense foliage of which apertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique lattices. As we passed this sheltered nest, the parson issued forth and preceded us.I had expected to see a sleek well-conditioned pastor, such as is often found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron's table; but I was disappointed. The parson was a little, meagre, black-looking man, with a grizzled wig that was too wide, and stood off from each ear; so that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it, like a dried filbert in its shell. He wore a rusty coat, with great skirts, and pockets that would",20656_53.jpg

It was, he observed, an unholy plant, profaned by having been used by the Druids in their mystic ceremonies; and though it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of halls and kitchens, yet it had been deemed by the Fathers of the Church as unhallowed, and totally unfit for sacred purposes. So tenacious was he on this point, that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great part of the humble trophies of his taste, before the parson would consent to enter upon the service of the day.The interior of the church was venerable but simple; on the walls were several mural monuments of the Bracebridges, and just beside the",20656_54.jpg
347,3,347_3.jpg," altar was a tomb of ancient workmanship, on which lay the effigy of a warrior in armour, with his legs crossed, a sign of his having been a crusader. I was told it was one of the family who had signalised himself in the Holy Land, and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the hall.During service, Master Simon stood up in the pew, and repeated the responses very audibly; evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion punctually observed by a gentleman of the old school, and a man of old family connections. I observed, too, that he turned over the leaves of a folio prayer-book with something of a flourish; possibly to show off an enormous seal-ring which",20656_55.jpg
348,0,348_0.jpg," enriched one of his fingers, and which had the look of a family relic. But he was evidently most solicitous about the musical part of the service, keeping his eye fixed intently on the choir, and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis.""The orchestra was in a small gallery, and presented a most whimsical grouping of heads.""—",20656_56.jpg

348,3,348_3.jpg," singers, to which the keen air of a frosty morning had given a bright rosy tint; but the gentlemen choristers had evidently been chosen, like old Cremona fiddles, more for tone than looks; and as several had to sing from the same book, there were clusterings of odd physiognomies, not unlike those groups of cherubs we sometimes see on country tombstones.The usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well, the vocal parts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental, and some loitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling over a passage with prodigious celerity, and clearing more bars than the keenest fox-hunter, to be in at the death. But the great trial was an anthem that had been prepared and arranged by Master Simon, and on which he had founded great expectation. Unluckily there was a blunder at the very outset; the musicians became flurried; Master Simon was in a fever, everything went on lamely and irregularly until",20656_59.jpg

The villagers doffed their hats to the Squire as he passed, giving him the good wishes of the season with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity, and were invited by him to the hall, to take something to keep out the cold of the weather; and I heard blessings uttered by several of the poor, which convinced me that, in the midst of his enjoyments, the worthy old cavalier had not forgotten the true Christmas virtue of charity.On our way homeward his heart seemed overflowing with generous and happy feelings. As we passed over a rising ground which commanded something of a prospect, the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our ears; the Squire paused for a few moments, and looked around with an air of inexpressible benignity.

The country people, however, did not understand how to play their parts in the scene of hospitality; many uncouth circumstances occurred; the manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country, and more beggars drawn into the neighbourhood in one week than the parish officers could get rid of in a year. Since then he had contented himself with inviting the decent part of the neighbouring peasantry to call at the hall on Christmas day, and distributing beef, and bread, and ale, among the poor, that they might make merry in their own dwellings.",20656_64.jpg

""It was now,"" he said, ""nearly extinct, but he had",20656_65.jpg
350,2,350_2.jpg," accidentally met with traces of it in the neighbourhood, and had encouraged its revival; though, to tell the truth, it was too apt to be followed up by rough cudgel-play and broken heads in the evening.""After the dance was concluded, the whole party was entertained with brawn and beef, and stout home-brewed. The Squire himself mingled among the rustics, and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference and regard.

He was a visitor at every farm-house and cottage; gossiped with the farmers and their wives; romped with their daughters; and, like that type of a vagrant bachelor, the humble bee, tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country round.The bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and affability. There is something genuine and affectionate in the gaiety of the lower orders, when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of those above them; the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth, and a kind word or a small pleasantry, frankly uttered by a patron, gladdens the heart of the dependant more",20656_67.png

354,2,354_2.jpg,"When the ladies had retired, the conversation, as usual, became still more animated; many good things were broached which had been thought of during dinner, but which would not exactly do for a lady's ear; and though I cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered, yet I have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less laughter.

The company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew duller.

These tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier among the rustics, yet when night came on, there were many of the stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath that led across the churchyard.From these and other anecdotes that followed, the crusader appeared to be the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout the vicinity. His picture, which hung up in the hall, was thought by the servants to have something supernatural about it; for they remarked that, in whatever part of the hall you went, the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you. The old porter's wife, too, at the lodge, who had been born and brought",20656_86.jpg

He listened to every goblin tale of the neighbouring gossips with infinite gravity, and held the porter's wife in high favour on account of her talent for the marvellous. He was himself a great reader of old legends and romances, and often lamented that he could not believe in them; for a superstitious person, he thought, must live in a kind of fairyland.Whilst we were all attention to the parson's",20656_87.jpg

Come with me and I’ll show you!”“No,” said Bab-ba, shaking his head; but Hoodo continued to look at him steadily, and presently Bab-ba slid down from the verandah and came towards him.Then Hoodo laughed and drew back quickly into the thick part of the garden, with Bab-ba running after him.",20693_12.jpg

All their time was spent before the looking-glass, and more than a dozen laces were broken in attempts to tighten their waists into elegant shapes.At length the long-wished-for evening arrived, and these proud misses ",20723_2.jpg

The most difficult part of our task is already accomplished, and it will be hard if I cannot make your dress correspond with your coach and servants.”On saying this, the fairy touched Cinderella with her magic wand, and her clothes were instantly changed into a most magnificent ball-dress, ornamented with the most costly jewels.

""No, not all, for the largest egg is still here. How long will this last? I am so weary of it!"" And then she sat down again.""Well, and how are you getting on?"" asked an old Duck, who had come to pay her a visit.""This one egg keeps me so long,"" said the mother. ""It will not break.

I was cheated in the same way once myself, and I had such trouble with the young ones; for they were afraid of the water, and I could not get them there. I called and scolded, but it was all of no use. But let me see the egg—ah, yes! to be sure, that is a turkey's egg. Leave it, and teach the other little ones to swim.""

It was amusing to hear this bird pass from a soft, girlish voice to his hoarse and sailor-like tone.Not only has the parrot the power of imitating the human voice, but it seems to wish to do so.

The only way of coming was by a merchant-vessel. So Bernard, who was looking and longing for the arrival of his brother, did not think it strange when six weeks passed away without bringing him. But when two months passed, and he did not appear, poor Bernard began to be anxious. Four months, five months, six months, passed. Nothing was heard of John. Not a word came from Mr. Trainier. More than a year passed away, and still there was no news. Bernard was in despair.One August day (it must have been, I think, in the year 1805), when my father had occasion to visit Boston, he took Bernard with him; and, while there, went with him to call on Mr. Duprez, from whom they hoped to hear some good news.But there was no comfort for poor Bernard in what Mr. Duprez had to tell. He had learned from friends in Toulon that Mr. Trainier, soon after sending his youngest son to America, had gone to St. Domingo to look after some estates. St. Domingo was then in a state of insurrection. The slaves had risen against their masters.

Poor Milo seemed to be aware of our kind act. After that, it seemed as if he could not do too much to show his gratitude.How patiently he would stand on his legs, or march with us in our mimic ranks as a soldier, when we went forth to battle! In all our plays we could not do without Milo. He would stand on guard beside our camp; and he it was who always had to fire the pistol when a deserter was to be shot.Sometimes we would play going through the woods, where the Indians were likely to waylay us. Then Milo was our pathfinder. With his nice sense of smell he must find out where the cunning redskins were lying in wait.There was no end to the uses to which we put the dear little dog in our plays. Never did he snarl, or lose his temper. He saw that we loved him; and he repaid our love by taking all the pains he could to please us.But a dark time came for Milo and for us.

We could not bear the thought.The little dog himself saw that something was the matter, and whined at seeing us all so sad. All at once up started our eldest brother, Robert, and declared it should not be. He would rescue the little dog.He did so without letting any one know of his plan. He took Milo, at night, in the cars, to the nearest great city. Here one of our cousins lived. Placing Milo in his charge, Robert came back; and when the town-officer came after the little dog, to kill him, he was told that Milo had stepped out, and, if the town-folks wanted him, they must find him.In a few months, the outcry about mad dogs was hushed; and then we had Milo home again.

381,1,381_1.jpg,"They turned her thoughts from her grief; and as soon as she had put them on she ran in to Mrs. Smith and cried out: ""Two shoes, ma'am, two shoes!"" These words she repeated to every one she met, and thus it was she got the name of Goody Two Shoes.",21428_1.jpg
381,2,381_2.jpg,"Two Shoes, Ma'am. Two Shoes.Little Margery had seen how good and wise Mr. Smith was, and thought it was because of his great learning; and she wanted, above all things, to learn to read. At last she made up her mind to ask Mr. Smith to teach her when he had a moment to spare. He readily agreed to do this, and Margery read to him an hour every day, and spent much time with her books.Then she laid out a plan for teaching others more ignorant than herself. She cut out of thin pieces of wood ten sets of large and small letters of the alphabet, and carried these with her when she went from house to house. When she came to Billy Wilson's she threw down the letters all in a heap, and Billy picked them out and sorted them in lines, thus:and so on until all the letters were in their right places.From there Goody Two Shoes trotted off to another cottage, and here were several children waiting for her. As soon as the little girl came in they all crowded around her, and were eager to begin their lessons at once.Then she threw the letters down and said to the boy next her, ""What did you have for dinner to-day?"" ""Bread,"" answered the little boy. ""Well, put down the first letter,"" said Goody Two Shoes. Then he put down B, and the next child R, and the next E, and the next A, and the next D, and there was the whole word—BREAD.""What did you have for dinner, Polly Driggs?""""Apple-pie,"" said Polly; upon which she laid down the first letter, A, and the next put down a P, and the next another P, and so on until the words Apple and Pie were united, and stood thus: APPLE PIE.",21428_2.jpg
381,3,381_3.jpg,"She had not been there long before she heard footsteps, and three men came into the barn for shelter. The hay was piled up between her and them, so that they could not see her, and, thinking they were alone, they spoke quite loudly.",21428_3.jpg
382,0,382_0.jpg,"Plotting to rob Squire TruemanThey were plotting to rob Squire Trueman, who lived in the great house in Margery's village, and were to break in and steal all they could that very night. This was quite enough for Goody Two Shoes. She waited for nothing, but dashed out of the barn, and ran through rain and mud till she came to the Squire's house.He was at dinner with some friends, and any one else but Goody would have found it difficult to gain admission to him. But she was well known to the servants, and was so kind and obliging, that even the big fat butler could not refuse to do her bidding, and went and told the squire that Goody Two Shoes wished very much to see him.So the squire asked his friends to excuse him for a moment, and came out and said, ""Well, Goody Two Shoes, my good girl, what is it?"" ""Oh, sir,"" she replied, ""if you do not take care you will be robbed and murdered this very night!""Then she told all she had heard the men say while she was in the barn.The squire saw there was not a moment to lose, so he went back and told his friends the news he had heard. They all said they would stay and help him take the thieves. So the lights were put out, to make it appear as if all the people in the house were in bed, and servants and all kept a close watch both inside and outside.Sure enough, at about one o'clock in the morning the three men came creeping, creeping up to the house with a dark lantern, and the tools to break in with. Before they were aware, six men sprang out on them, and held them fast. The thieves struggled in vain to get away. They were locked in an out-house until daylight, when a cart came and took them off to jail.They were afterward sent out of the country, where they had to work in chains on the roads; and it is said that one of them behaved so well that he was pardoned, and went to live at Australia, where he became a rich man.",21428_4.jpg
382,1,382_1.jpg,"Goody warns the SquireMrs. Williams, who lived in Margery's village, kept school, and taught little ones their A B C's. She was now old and feeble, and wanted to give up this important trust.",21428_5.jpg
382,2,382_2.jpg,"This being known to Sir William Dove, he asked Mrs. Williams to examine Goody Two Shoes and see if she was not clever enough for the office. This was done, and Mrs. Williams reported that little Margery was the best scholar, and had the best heart of any one she had ever examined. All the country had a great opinion of Mrs. Williams, and this report made them think highly of Miss MARGERY, as we must now call her.So Margery Meanwell was now a schoolmistress, and a capital one she made. The children all loved her, for she was never weary of making plans for their happiness.The room in which she taught was large and lofty, and there was plenty of fresh air in it; and as she knew that children liked to move about, she placed her sets of letters all round the school, so that every one was obliged to get up to find a letter, or spell a word, when it came their turn.This exercise not only kept the children in good health, but fixed the letters firmly in their minds.The neighbors were very good to her, and one of them made her a present of a little skylark, whose early morning song told the lazy boys and girls that it was time they were out of bed.Some time after this a poor lamb lost its dam, and the farmer being about to kill it, she bought it of him, and brought it home to play with the children.Soon after this a present was made to Miss Margery of a dog, and as he was always in good humor, and always jumping about, the children gave him the name of Jumper. It was his duty to guard the door, and no one could go out or come in without leave from his mistress.Margery was so wise and good that some foolish people accused her of being a witch, and she was taken to court and tried before the judge. She soon proved that she was a most sensible woman, and Sir Charles Jones was so pleased with her, that he offered her a large sum of money to take care of his family, and educate his daughter. At first she refused, but afterwards went and behaved so well, and was so kind and tender, that Sir Charles would not permit her to leave the house, and soon after made her an offer of marriage.",21428_6.jpg

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

383,1,383_1.jpg,"By CHARLES H. BENNETT.There once lived happily together, in a fine house, a tortoise-shell Cat and a pretty white Dog: the Cat’s name was Tittums; the Dog’s, Fido. In course of time the pretty Dog fell in love with the Cat, and only waited for a good chance to disclose his affections. This came one day, when Tittums had put her paws on the fender, dropped her head a little on one side, half closed her eyes, and seemed thinking of nothing at all. Then Fido, who lay stretched at full length upon the hearth-rug, looked steadfastly at her, and heaving a gentle whine, said,—“Oh, Tittums, I’ve fallen in love!”“Indeed!” replied the prudent Cat, not wishing to show him how anxious she was.“Yes, indeed,” continued the little Doggy, rather hurt at her coldness: “it’s you that I’ve fallen in love with. Do you like me, Tittums?”But Tittums would not answer, even with a single ! and it was only upon her giving him a sly look out of the corner of her left eye that he guessed how much she did like him. However, made bold by even this small token of esteem, he came quietly up, and sat by her side; even going so far, at last, as to take her out for a short walk down the garden-path, where they looked through the railings at the people passing by.“Well,” said Fido to himself, “I have no doubt but she will love me in time; all the more, as I have great hopes of growing bigger before the spring.”But one morning, when Tittums came in from a visit she had been paying her mamma, she was followed by a gentleman from the tropics, who, with all the impudence of his race, made himself quite at home, pressed Tittums’ paw to his heart, called her “the loveliest of Cats,” asked her to oblige him with a song, which he had been told she could sing very sweetly, and never took the least notice of poor Fido, who was sitting in the corner. To tell the truth, poor Fido was very cross, and began to growl quite savagely; the more so when, to his dismay, he beheld the pleasure with which Tittums heard all this nonsense. He could not think what right the bold stranger had to come there unasked; for all that he had bright red and green feathers, a rakish, broad-brimmed hat, and a gold-headed walking-cane, he was not good-looking, that was very certain.But Tittums was very much struck by his appearance and bearing; his feathers were so pretty, he spoke so many languages, shrieked so terribly and in such a loud voice, had travelled so much, and was so struck by the beauty of Tittums, that, poor little Cat as she was, she ceased to care a button for faithful Fido, and kept all her sly glances for Mr. Paul Parrot.“Lovely Tittums,” said Mr. Paul, “you must forget such upstart puppies as Fido. Listen to me—I am a traveller—I speak five languages,—I have a palace made of golden bars, within which is a perch fit for a king,—I have a pension of bread and milk and Barcelona nuts: all of which I will share with you. To-morrow we will go for a trip into the field next to the house. Good-by for the present, my dear Pussy Cat;” and he went away kissing his hand.",21884_1.jpg

Naughty Tittums!As day followed day, Miss Puss neglected her little Dog more and more. She walked out with Mr. Paul Parrot, she sang to him, looked kindly at him, and, in fact, only seemed happy when he was by. Poor Fido was true to his first love, although almost brought to despair; he got very thin indeed, and his fine bushy coat, which he had kept nice and clean, became ragged and dirty.Indeed, Mr. Parrot carried all before him; he was so grand, so loving, and so clever, that Fido from being deserted became despised, and was indeed thinking about hanging himself on the meat-hook in the kitchen.",21884_2.jpg

385,1,385_1.jpg,"       As time went on, Prince Prigio had two younger brothers, whom everybody       liked: They were not a bit clever, but jolly. Prince Alphonso, the third       son, was round, fat, good-humoured, and as brave as a lion. Prince Enrico,       the second, was tall, thin, and a “little sad, but  too       clever.” Both were in love with two of their own cousins (with the       approval of their dear parents); and all the world said, “What nice,       unaffected princes they are!” But Prigio nearly got the country into       several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors. Now, as       Pantouflia was a rich, lazy country, which hated fighting, this was very       unpleasant, and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better.     ",21935_1.jpg
385,2,385_2.jpg,"       There was a very hot summer! It began to be hot in March.’ All the rivers       were dried up. The grass did not grow. The corn did not grow. The       thermometers exploded with heat. The barometers stood at Set Fair. The       people were much distressed, and came and broke the palace win-dows—as       they usually do when things go wrong in Pantouflia.            The king consulted the learned men about the Court, who told him that       probably a FIREDRAKE was in the neighbourhood.            Now, the Firedrake is a beast, or bird, about the bigness of an elephant.       Its body is made of iron, and it is always red-hot. A more terrible and       cruel beast cannot be imagined; for, if you go near it, you are at once       broiled by the Firedrake.            But the king was not ill-pleased: “for,” thought he, “of course my three       sons must go after the brute, the eldest first; and, as usual, it will       kill the first two, and be beaten by the youngest. It is a little hard on       Enrico, poor boy; but  to get rid of that Prigio!”             Then the king went to Prigio, and said that his country was in danger, and       that he was determined to leave the crown to whichever of them would bring       him the horns (for it has horns) and tail of the Firedrake.            “It is an awkward brute to tackle,” the king said, “but you are the       oldest, my lad; go where glory waits you! Put on your armour, and be off       with you!”      ",21935_2.jpg
385,3,385_3.jpg,"       This the king said, hoping that either the Firedrake would roast Prince       Prigio alive (which he could easily do, as I have said; for he is all over       as hot as a red-hot poker), or that, if the prince succeeded, at least his       country would be freed from the monster.            But the prince, who was lying on the sofa doing sums in compound division,       for fun, said in the politest way:            “Thanks to the education your majesty has given me, I have learned that       the Firedrake, like the siren, the fairy, and so forth, is a fabulous       animal which does not exist. But even granting, for the sake of argument,       that there is a Firedrake, your majesty is well aware that there is no       kind of use in sending . It is always the eldest son who goes out       first, and comes to grief on these occasions, and it is always the third       son that succeeds. Send Alphonso” (this was the youngest brother), “and        will do the trick at once. At least, if he fails, it will be most unusual,       and Enrico can try his luck.”             Then he went back to his arithmetic and his slate, and the king had to       send for Prince Alphonso and Prince Enrico. They both came in very warm;       for they had been whipping tops, and the day was unusually hot.            “Look here,” said the king, “just you two younger ones look at Prigio! You       see how hot it is, and how coolly he takes it, and the country suffering;       and all on account of a Firedrake, you know, which has apparently built       his nest not far off. Well, I have asked that lout of a brother of yours       to kill it, and he says—”             “That he does not believe in Firedrakes,” interrupted Prigio, “The       weather’s warm enough without going out hunting!”      ",21935_3.jpg
386,0,386_0.jpg,"       “Oh, excuse me,” said the prince, “I am certain he has merely gone off on       his travels. He’ll come back when he’s tired: there  no       Firedrakes; a French writer says they are ‘purement fabuleux, purely       fabulous, you know.”             “Prince Alphonso has gone on his travels, and will come back when he is       tired! And was he then—tired—of ?” cried poor       Molinda, bursting into tears, and forgetting her dignity.            “Oh! I beg your pardon, I never noticed; I’m sure I am very sorry,” cried       the prince, who, never having been in love himself, never thought of other       people. And he tried to take Molinda’s hand, but she snatched it from him       and ran away through the garden to the palace, leaving Prince Prigio to       feel foolish, for once, and ashamed.            As for Lady Kathleena, she swept past him like a queen, without a word. So       the prince, for all his cleverness, was not happy.            After several days had gone by, the king returned from the solitary place       where he had been speaking his mind. He now felt calmer and better; and so       at last he came back to the palace. But on seeing Prince Prigio, who was       lolling in a hammock, translating Egyptian hieroglyphs into French poetry       for his mother, the king broke out afresh, and made use of the most cruel       and impolite expressions.            At last, he gave orders that all the Court should pack up and move to a       distant city; and that Prince Prigio should be left alone in the palace by       himself. For he was quite unendurable, the king said, and he could not       trust his own temper when he thought of him. And he grew so fierce, that       even the queen was afraid of him now.     ",21935_4.jpg
386,1,386_1.jpg,"       He sat down at a table, however, and shouted “” at which       all the waiters jumped, and looked round in every direction, but nobody       came to him. At first he thought they were too busy, but presently another       explanation occurred to him.            “The king,” said he to himself, “has threatened to execute anybody who       speaks to me, or helps me in any way. Well, I don’t mean to starve in the       midst of plenty, anyhow; here goes!”             The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the room, where a       huge roast turkey had just been placed. He helped himself to half the       breast, some sausages, chestnut stuffing, bread sauce, potatoes, and a       bottle of red wine—Burgundy. He then went back to a table in a       corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of him. When he       had finished, he sat watching the other people dining, and smoking his       cigarette. As he was sitting thus, a very tall man, an officer in the       uniform of the Guards, came in, and, walking straight to the prince’s       table, said: “Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of fare.”             With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the prince’s lap, as if       he did not see him at all. He was a heavy man, and the prince, enraged at       the insult, pushed him away and jumped to his feet. As he did so, his       cap dropped off. The officer fell on his knees at once, crying:            “Pardon, my prince, pardon! I never saw you!”      ",21935_5.jpg
386,2,386_2.jpg,"       By this time, you or I, or anyone who was not so extremely clever as       Prince Prigio, would have understood what was the matter. He had put on,       without knowing it, not only the seven-league boots, but the cap of       darkness, and had taken Fortunatus’s purse, which could never be empty,       however often you took all the money out. All those and many other       delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening, and the       prince had found them in the dark garret. But the prince was so extremely       wise, and learned, and scientific, that he did not believe in fairies, nor       in fairy gifts.            “It is indigestion,” he said to himself: “those sausages were not of the       best; and that Burgundy was extremely strong. Things are not as they       appear.”             Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over by a splendid       carriage and six, the driver of which never took the slightest notice of       him. Annoyed at this, the prince leaped up behind, threw down the two       footmen, who made no resistance, and so was carried to the door of a       magnificent palace. He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was       in the carriage; but, noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady       with him, whom he had never seen before, he followed them into the house,       not wishing to alarm the girl, and meaning to speak to the gentleman when       he found him alone.            A great ball was going on; but, as usual, nobody took any notice of the       prince. He walked among the guests, being careful not to jostle them, and       listening to their conversation.            It was all about himself! Everyone had heard of his disgrace, and almost       everyone cried “Serve him right!” They said that the airs he gave himself       were quite unendurable—that nothing was more rude than to be always       in the right—that cleverness might be carried far too far—that       it was better even to be born stupid (“Like the rest of you,” thought the       prince); and, in fact, nobody had a good word for him.            Yes, one had! It was the pretty lady of the carriage. I never could tell       you how pretty she was. She was tall, with cheeks like white roses       blushing: she had dark hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face       was the kindest in the world! The prince first thought how nice and good       she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked.  stood       up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him. She had       never seen the prince, for she was but newly come to Pantouflia; but she       declared that it was his , not his fault, to be so       clever. “And, then, think how hard they made him work at school! Besides,”        said this kind young lady, “I hear he is extremely handsome, and very       brave; and he has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor       boy, and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy passed       first in ",21935_6.jpg
386,3,386_3.jpg,"       When he arrived at the house where the ball was going on, he put the       magical carpet in the portmanteau, and left it in the cloakroom, receiving       a numbered ticket in exchange. Then he marched in all his glory (and, of       course, without the cap of darkness) into the room where they were       dancing. Everybody made place for him, bowing down to the ground, and the       loyal band struck up        Heaven bless our Prince Prigio! What is there he doesn’t know? Greek,       Swiss, German (High and Low), And the names of the mountains in Mexico,       Heaven bless the prince!            He used to be very fond of this march, and the words—some people       even said he had made them himself. But now, somehow, he didn’t much like       it. He went straight to the Duke of Stumpfelbahn, the Hereditary Master of       the Ceremonies, and asked to be introduced to the beautiful young lady.       She was the daughter of the new English Ambassador, and her name was Lady       Rosalind. But she nearly fainted when she heard who it was that wished to       dance with her, for she was not at all particularly clever; and the prince       had such a bad character for snubbing girls, and asking them difficult       questions. However, it was impossible to refuse, and so she danced with       the prince, and he danced very well. Then they sat out in the       conservatory, among the flowers, where nobody came near them; and then       they danced again, and then the Prince took her down to supper. And all       the time he never once said, “Have you read ” or “Have you       read ” or, “What! you never heard of Alexander the Great?” or       Julius Caesar, or Michael Angelo, or whoever it might be—horrid,       difficult questions he used to ask. That was the way he  to go       on: but now he only talked to the young lady about ; and she       quite left off being shy or frightened, and asked him all about his own       country, and about the Firedrake shooting, and said how fond she was of       hunting herself. And the prince said:      wish it, you shall have the horns and tail of a       Firedrake to hang up in your hall, to-morrow evening!”      ",21935_7.jpg
387,0,387_0.jpg,"       For, even a clever person can be nice when he likes—above all, when       he is not thinking about himself. And now the prince was thinking of       nothing in the world but the daughter of the English Ambassador, and how       to please her-He got introduced to her father too, and quite won his       heart; and, at last, he was invited to dine next day at the Embassy.            In Pantouflia, it is the custom that a ball must not end while one of the       royal family goes on dancing.  ball lasted till the light came       in, and the birds were singing out of doors, and all the mothers present       were sound asleep.            Then nothing would satisfy the prince, but that they all should go home       singing through the streets; in fact, there never had been so merry a       dance in all Pantouflia. The prince had made a point of dancing with       almost every girl there: and he had suddenly become the most beloved of       the royal family. But everything must end at last; and the prince, putting       on the cap of darkness and sitting on the famous carpet, flew back to his       lonely castle.     ",21935_8.jpg
387,1,387_1.jpg,"       The prince did not like the looks of him.            “With all my cap of darkness, and my shoes of swiftness, and my sword of       sharpness, I never could get near that beast,” he said; “and if I        stalk him, I could not hurt him. Poor little Alphonso! poor Enrico! what       plucky fellows they were! I fancied that there was no such thing as a       Firedrake: he’s not in the Natural History books; and I thought the boys       were only making fun, and would be back soon, safe and sound. How horrid       being too clever makes one! And now, what        What was he to do, indeed? And what would you have done? Bring the horns       and tail he must, or perish in the adventure. Otherwise, how could he meet       his lady?—why, she would think him a mere braggart.            The prince sat down, and thought and thought; and the day went on, and it       was now high noon.            At last he jumped up and rushed into the library, a room where nobody ever       went except himself and the queen. There he turned the books upside down,       in his haste, till he found an old one, by a French gentleman, Monsieur       Cyrano de Bergerac. It was an account of a voyage to the moon, in which       there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known;       for few travellers have been to the moon. In that book, Prince Prigio       fancied he would find something he half remembered, and that would be of       use to him. And he  So you see that cleverness, and minding       your book, have some advantages, after all. For here the prince learned       that there is a very rare beast called a Remora, which is at least as cold       as the Firedrake is hot!            “Now,” thought he, “",21935_9.jpg
387,2,387_2.jpg,"       “Hooray!” said the prince softly to himself; and he jumped like mad into       the winged shoes of swiftness, stuck on the cap of darkness, girdled       himself with the sword of sharpness, and put a good slice of bread, with       some cold tongue, in a wallet, which he slung on his back. Never you       fight, if you can help it, except with plenty of food to keep you going       and in good heart. Then off he flew, and soon he reached the volcano of       the Firedrake.     ",21935_10.jpg
387,3,387_3.jpg,"       The prince, watching from the hill-top, could scarcely believe that these       two awful scourges of Nature, which had so long devastated his       country, were actually dead. But when he had looked on for half-an-hour,       and only a river ran where the Remora had been, while the body of the       Firedrake lay stark and cold, he hurried to the spot.            Drawing the sword of sharpness, he hacked off, at two blows, the iron head       and the tail of the Firedrake. They were a weary weight to carry; but in a       few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle, where he threw       down his burden, and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue.            But the castle clock struck half-past seven; dinner was at eight, and the       poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret. Here he put on the       wishing-cap; wished for a pint of champagne, a hot bath, and his best       black velvet and diamond suit. In a moment these were provided; he bathed,       dressed, drank a glass of wine, packed up the head and tail of the       Firedrake; sat down on the flying carpet, and knocked at the door of the       English Ambassador as the clocks were striking eight’ in Gluckstein.     Punctuality is the politeness of princes; and a prince        polite when he is in love!     ",21935_11.jpg
388,0,388_0.jpg,"       But before the words was out of his mouth, off he flies like a shot       through the open door, and his royaliness’s parcel with him. I run to the       door, and there he was, flying right hover the town, in a northerly       direction. And that’s all I know; for I would not tell a lie, not if it       was hever so. And me, and Thomas—as didn’t see it,—and cook,       we thinks as how Benson was come for. And cook says as she don’t wonder at       it, neither; for a grumblinger, more ill-conditioneder—”             “Thank you, William,” said Lord Kelso; “that will do; you can go, for the       present.”      ",21935_12.jpg
388,1,388_1.jpg,"       “Well, we asked him  he killed the Firedrake, and he said in a       garden near Gluckstein. Then he began to speak about the reward, and the       ‘perkisits,’ as he called them, which it seems he had read about in my       proclamation. Rather a neat thing; drew it up myself,” added his majesty.            “Very much to the point,” said the ambassador, wondering what the king was       coming to.            “Glad you like it,” said the king, much pleased. “Well, where was I? Oh,       yes; your man said he had killed the creature in a garden, quite near       Gluckstein. I didn’t much like the whole affair: he is an alien, you see;       and then there was my niece, Molinda—poor girl,  was       certain to give trouble. Her heart is buried, if I may say so, with poor       Alphonso. But the queen is a very remarkable woman—very remarkable—”             “Very!” said the ambassador, with perfect truth.            “‘Caitiff!’ she cries to your butler,” his majesty went on; “‘perjured       knave, thou liest in thy throat! Gluckstein is a hundred leagues from       here, and how say est thou that thou slewest the molester, and earnest       hither in a few hours’ space?’ This had not occurred to me,—I am a       plain king, but I at once saw the force of her majesty’s argument. Yes,’       said I; ‘how did you manage it?’ But he—your man, I mean—was       not a bit put out. ‘Why, your majesty,’ says he, ‘I just sat down on that       there bit of carpet, wished I was here, and here . And I ‘d be       glad, having had the trouble,—and my time not being my own,—to       see the colour of them perkisits, according to the proclamation.’ On this       her majesty grew more indignant, if possible. ‘Nonsense!’ she cried; ‘a       story out of the ‘Arabian Nights’ is not suited for a modern public, and       fails to win æsthetic credence.’ These were her very words.”      ",21935_13.jpg
388,2,388_2.jpg,"       “There!” said his majesty, crossing his cheque and throwing sand over it,       for blotting-paper had not yet been invented; “there, take ,       and be off with you!”             Prince Prigio was respectfully but rapidly obeying his royal command, for       he thought he had better cash the royal cheque as soon as possible, when       his majesty yelled:            “Hi! here! come back! I forgot something; you’ve got to marry Molinda!”      ",21935_14.jpg
388,3,388_3.jpg,"       “I was about to say, sir,” the prince went on, “that I cannot possibly       have the pleasure of wedding my cousin.”             “The family gibbet, I presume, is in good working order?” asked the king       of the family executioner, a tall gaunt man in black and scarlet, who was       only employed in the case of members of the blood royal.            “Never better, sire,” said the man, bowing with more courtliness than his       profession indicated.            “Very well,” said the king; “Prince Prigio, you have your choice.  is Lady Molinda. My duty is painful, but       clear. A king’s word cannot be broken. Molly, or the gibbet!”             The prince bowed respectfully to Lady Molinda:            “Madam, my cousin,” said he, “your clemency will excuse my answer, and you       will not misinterpret the apparent discourtesy of my conduct. I am       compelled, most unwillingly, to slight your charms, and to select the       Extreme Rigour of the Law. Executioner, lead on! Do your duty; for me, ;”—for this was his motto, and meant that he was ready.     ",21935_15.jpg
389,0,389_0.jpg,"       Poor Lady Molinda could not but be hurt by the prince’s preference for       death over marriage to her, little as she liked him.            “Is life, then, so worthless? and is Molinda so terrible a person that you       prefer  arms,” and she pointed to the gibbet, “to ”—here       she held out her own, which were very white, round and pretty; for Molinda       was a good-hearted girl, she could not bear to see Prigio put to death;       and then, perhaps, she reflected that there are worse positions than the       queenship of Pantouflia. For Alphonso was gone—crying would not       bring him back.            “Ah, Madam!” said the prince, “you are forgiving—”       are brave!” said Molinda, feeling: quite a respect for       him.            “But neither your heart nor mine is ours to give. Since mine was       another’s, I understand too well the feeling of  Do not let       us buy life at the price of happiness and honour.”      ",21935_16.jpg
389,1,389_1.jpg,"       “Well,” said the prince at last, “he could not live long anyway, and it       must be done. He will feel nothing.”             Then he drew the sword of sharpness, and with one turn of his wrist cut       the cat’s head clean off.            It did not at once change into a beautiful young lady, as perhaps you       expect; no, that was improbable, and, as the prince was in love already,       would have been vastly inconvenient. The dead cat lay there, like any       common cat.            Then the prince built up a heap of straw, with wood on it; and there he       laid poor puss, and set fire to the pile. Very soon there was nothing of       old black Frank left but ashes!            Then the prince ran upstairs to the fairy cupboard, his heart beating       loudly with excitement, The sun was shining through the arrow-shot window;       all the yellow motes were dancing in its rays. The light fell on the       strange heaps of fairy things—talismans and spells. The prince       hunted about here and there, and at last he discovered six ancient       water-vessels of black leather, each with a silver plate on it, and on the       plate letters engraved. This was what was written on the plates:     AQVA. DE. FONTE. LEONVM.      * Water from the Fountain of Lions.        “Thank heaven!” said the prince. “I thought they were sure to have brought       it!”      ",21935_17.jpg
389,2,389_2.jpg,"       He opened the bottle, and poured a few drops of the water on the ashes and       the dying embers.            Up there sprang a tall, white flame of fire, waving like a tongue of       light; and forth from the heap jumped the most beautiful, strong, funny,       black cat that ever was seen!            It was Frank as he had been in the vigour of his youth; and he knew the       prince at once, and rubbed himself against him and purred.            The prince lifted up Frank and kissed his nose for joy; and a bright tear       rolled down on Frank’s face, and made him rub his nose with his paw in the       most comical manner.            Then the prince set him down, and he ran round and round after his tail;       and, lastly, cocked his tail up, and marched proudly after the prince into       the castle.            “Oh, Frank!” said Prince Prigio, “no cat since the time of Puss in Boots       was ever so well taken care of as you shall be. For if the fairy water       from the Fountain of Lions can bring  back to life—why,       there is a chance for Alphonso and Enrico!”             Then Prigio bustled about, got ready some cold luncheon from the       store-room, took all his fairy things that he was likely to need, sat down       with them on the flying carpet, and wished himself at the mountain of the       Firedrake.     ",21935_18.jpg
389,3,389_3.jpg,"       Off they went, the horses’ hoofs clattering, banners flying, sunshine       glittering on the spear-points. Off they rode to Falkenstein; and when the       king saw them come galloping in, I can tell you he had no more notion of       hanging Prigio.     ",21935_19.jpg

425,1,425_1.jpg,"THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.—One of your old-world stories, Uncle John, Such as you tell us by the winter fire, Till we all wonder it has grown so late.—The story of the witch that ground to death Two children in her mill, or will you have The tale of Goody Cutpurse?",22406_1.jpg
425,2,425_2.jpg,"—               Nay, now, nay; Those stories are too childish, Uncle John, Too childish even for little Willy here, And I am older, two good years, than he; No, let us have a tale of elves that ride, By night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine, Or water-fairies, such as you know how To spin, till Willy's eyes forget to wink, And good Aunt Mary, busy as she is, Lays down her knitting.—      Listen to me, then. 'Twas in the olden time, long, long ago, And long before the great oak at our door Was yet an acorn, on a mountain's side",22406_2.jpg
425,3,425_3.jpg," Seek the Armenian vales. That mountain rose So high, that, on its top, the winter snow Was never melted, and the cottagers Among the summer blossoms, far below, Saw its white peaks in August from their door.One little maiden, in that cottage home, Dwelt with her parents, light of heart and limb, Bright, restless, thoughtless, flitting here and there,",22406_3.jpg
426,0,426_0.jpg,"Like sunshine on the uneasy ocean waves, And sometimes she forgot what she was bid,—  Or Willy, quite as oft.—But you are older, Alice, two good years, And should be wiser. Eva was the name Of this young maiden, now twelve summers old. Now you must know that, in those early times,",22406_4.jpg

426,2,426_2.jpg," Among these Little People of the Snow! To them the sun's warm beams were shafts of fire, And the soft south wind was the wind of death. Away they flew, all with a pretty scowl Upon their childish faces, to the north, Or scampered upward to the mountain's top, And there defied their enemy, the Spring; Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks,",22406_6.jpg

427,0,427_0.jpg,"—            You are right, But I must speak of graver matters now.Mid-winter was the time, and Eva stood, Within the cottage, all prepared to dare The outer cold, with ample furry robe Close belted round her waist, and boots of fur, And a broad kerchief, which her mother's hand Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek.",22406_8.jpg
427,1,427_1.jpg,"""Now, stay not long abroad,"" said the good dame, ""For sharp is the outer air, and, mark me well, Go not upon the snow beyond the spot Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field.""The little maiden promised, and went forth, And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,",22406_9.jpg
427,2,427_2.jpg,"""Now, stay not long abroad,"" said the good dame, ""For sharp is the outer air, and, mark me well, Go not upon the snow beyond the spot Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field.""The little maiden promised, and went forth, And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,",22406_10.jpg
427,3,427_3.jpg," Where the great linden stood, set deep in snow, Up to the lower branches. ""Here we stop,"" Said Eva, ""for my mother has my word That I will go no further than this tree."" Then the snow-maiden laughed: ""And what is this? This fear of the pure snow, the innocent snow, That never harmed aught living? Thou mayst roam For leagues beyond this garden, and return",22406_11.jpg
428,0,428_0.jpg,"By such smooth words was Eva won to break Her promise, and went on with her new friend, Over the glistening snow and down a bank Where a white shelf, wrought by the eddying wind, Like to a billow's crest in the great sea, Curtained an opening. ""Look, we enter here."" And straight, beneath the fair o'erhanging fold, Entered the little pair that hill of snow,",22406_12.jpg
428,1,428_1.jpg,"Walking along a passage with white walls, And a white vault above where snow-stars shed A wintry twilight. Eva moved in awe, And held her peace, but the snow-maiden smiled, And talked and tripped along, as, down the way, Deeper they went into that mountainous drift.And now the white walls widened, and the vault Swelled upward, like some vast cathedral dome,",22406_13.jpg
428,2,428_2.jpg," The growths of summer. Here the palm upreared Its white columnar trunk and spotless sheaf Of plume-like leaves; here cedars, huge as those",22406_14.jpg
428,3,428_3.jpg," Of Lebanon, stretched far their level boughs, Yet pale and shadowless; the sturdy oak Stood, with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength,",22406_15.jpg
429,0,429_0.jpg," Beneath their little hands, to bowery walks In gardens such as these, and, o'er them all, Built the broad roof. ""But thou hast yet to see A fairer sight,"" she said, and led the way To where a window of pellucid ice Stood in the wall of snow, beside their path. ""Look, but thou mayst not enter."" Eva looked, And lo! a glorious hall, from whose high vault Stripes of soft light, ruddy, and delicate green, And tender blue, flowed downward to the floor And far around, as if the aerial hosts, That march on high by night, with beamy spears, And streaming banners, to that place had brought Their radiant flags to grace a festival.",22406_16.jpg
429,1,429_1.jpg,"And in all that hall a joyous multitude Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared, Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds, That rang from cymbals of transparent ice, And ice-cups, quivering to the skilful touch Of little fingers. Round and round they flew, As when, in spring, about a chimney-top, A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned,",22406_17.jpg
429,2,429_2.jpg," Of little fingers. Round and round they flew, As when, in spring, about a chimney-top, A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned, Wheel round and round, and turn and wheel again, Unwinding their swift track. So rapidly Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance, Beneath that dome of light. Bright eyes that looked From under lily brows, and gauzy scarfs",22406_18.jpg
429,3,429_3.jpg," Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun, Shot by the window in their mazy whirl.",22406_19.jpg
430,0,430_0.jpg," And there stood Eva, wondering at the sight Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep Of motion as they passed her;—long she gazed, And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled The frosty air, till now the encroaching cold Recalled her to herself. ""Too long, too long I linger here,"" she said, and then she sprang Into the path, and with a hurried step",22406_20.jpg
430,1,430_1.jpg," The hot tears started to her eyes; she knelt In the mid path. ""Father! forgive this sin; Forgive myself I cannot""—thus she prayed,",22406_21.jpg
430,2,430_2.jpg," And rose and hastened onward. When, at last, They reached the outer air, the clear north breathed A bitter cold, from which she shrank with dread, But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt The cutting blast, and uttered shouts of joy, And skipped, with boundless glee, from drift to drift, And danced round Eva, as she labored up The mounds of snow, ""Ah me! I feel my eyes Grow heavy,"" Eva said; ""they swim with sleep; I cannot walk for utter weariness, And I must rest a moment on this bank, But let it not be long."" As thus she spoke, In half-formed words, she sank on the smooth snow,",22406_22.jpg
430,3,430_3.jpg," Is this to slumber in; on such a couch Oft have I slept away the winter night, And had the sweetest dreams."" So Eva slept, But slept in death; for when the power of frost Locks up the motions of the living frame, The victim passes to the realm of Death Through the dim porch of Sleep. The little guide, Watching beside her, saw the hues of life",22406_23.jpg
431,0,431_0.jpg," Till they were white as marble, and the breath Had ceased to come and go, yet knew she not At first that this was death. But when she marked How deep the paleness was, how motionless That once lithe form, a fear came over her. She strove to wake the sleeper, plucked her robe, And shouted in her ear, but all in vain; The life had passed away from those young limbs.",22406_24.jpg
431,1,431_1.jpg," Were seeking Eva; from afar they saw The twain, and hurried toward them. As they came, With gentle chidings ready on their lips, And marked that death-like sleep, and heard the tale Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief And blame were uttered: ""Cruel, cruel one, To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we,",22406_25.jpg
431,2,431_2.jpg," And marked that death-like sleep, and heard the tale Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief And blame were uttered: ""Cruel, cruel one, To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we, Who suffered her to wander forth alone In this fierce cold."" They lifted the dear child, And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs,",22406_26.jpg
431,3,431_3.jpg," And strove, by all the simple arts they knew, To make the chilled blood move, and win the breath Back to her bosom; fruitlessly they strove. The little maid was dead. In blank despair They stood, and gazed at her who never more Should look on them. ""Why die we not with her?"" They said; ""without her life is bitterness.""",22406_27.jpg
432,0,432_0.jpg,"Now came the funeral day; the simple folk Of all that pastoral region gathered round, To share the sorrow of the cottagers. They carved a way into the mound of snow To the glen's side, and dug a little grave In the smooth slope, and, following the bier, In long procession from the silent door, Chanted a sad and solemn melody.",22406_28.jpg

Yea, lay her down whose pure and innocent life Was spotless as these snows; for she was reared In love, and passed in love life's pleasant spring, And all that now our tenderest love can do Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs.""They paused.

432,3,432_3.jpg,"From mountain-peak, and cloud, and icy hall, To Eva's burial. As the murmur died, The funeral train renewed the solemn chant.""Thou, Lord, hast taken her to be with Eve, Whose gentle name was given her. Even so, For so Thy wisdom saw that it was best For her and us. We bring our bleeding hearts, And ask the touch of healing from Thy hand,",22406_31.jpg
433,0,433_0.jpg,"They ceased. Again the plaintive murmur rose. From shadowy skirts of low-hung cloud it came, And wide white fields, and fir-trees capped with snow, Shivering to the sad sounds.

But, after Eva's burial, never more The Little People of the Snow were seen By human eye, nor ever human ear Heard from their lips, articulate speech again; For a decree went forth to cut them off, Forever, from communion with mankind.",22406_34.jpg
433,3,433_3.jpg," The winter clouds, along the mountain-side, Rolled downward toward the vale, but no fair form Leaned from their folds, and, in the icy glens, And aged woods, under snow-loaded pines, Where once they made their haunt, was emptiness.",22406_35.jpg

The people in the village will not know that you are in a frolic, and they will be afraid.""The flames did not heed her words, and the river of fire ran on and on, straight down the mountain. The flowers in its pathway perished. It leaped upon great trees and bore them to the earth. It drove the birds from their nests, and they fluttered about in the thick smoke. It hunted the wild creatures of the forest from the thickets where they hid, and they fled before it in terror.At last, one of the warriors in the village awoke. The thick smoke was in his nostrils. In his ears was the war-cry of the flames. He sprang to the door of his lodge and saw the fiery river leaping down the mountain. ""My people, my people,"" he cried, ""the flames are upon us!"" With cries of fear the people in the village fled far away into the forest, and the flames feasted upon the homes they loved.",22420_2.jpg

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.    *** START: FULL LICENSE ***  THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK  To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase ""Project Gutenberg""), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at http://gutenberg.org/license).   Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works  1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.  1.B.  ""Project Gutenberg"" is a registered trademark.  It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  See paragraph 1.E below.  1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (""the Foundation"" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.  1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.  1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:  1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" appears, or with which the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org  1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.  1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.  1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.  1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg-tm License.  1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than ""Plain Vanilla ASCII"" or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original ""Plain Vanilla ASCII"" or other form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.  1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.  1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided that  - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the      address specified in Section 4, ""Information about donations to      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.""  - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm      License.  You must require such a user to return or      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of      Project Gutenberg-tm works.  - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days      of receipt of the work.  - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.  1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.  1.F.  1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain ""Defects,"" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the ""Right of Replacement or Refund"" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.  1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email business@pglaf.org.

Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

520,1,520_1.jpg,"      Now Rann the Kite brings home the night         That Mang the Bat sets free—      The herds are shut in byre and hut         For loosed till dawn are we.      This is the hour of pride and power,         Talon and tush and claw.      Oh, hear the call!—Good hunting all         That keep the Jungle Law!      Night-Song in the Jungle        It was seven o’clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when       Father Wolf woke up from his day’s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and       spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling       in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her       four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the       cave where they all lived. “Augrh!” said Father Wolf. “It is time to hunt       again.” He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy       tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good luck go with you, O Chief of       the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children       that they may never forget the hungry in this world.”      ",236_1.jpg
520,2,520_2.jpg,"       “How little! How naked, and—how bold!” said Mother Wolf softly. The       baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.       “Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man’s cub.       Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man’s cub among her       children?”             “I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in       my time,” said Father Wolf. “He is altogether without hair, and I could       kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not afraid.”             The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan’s       great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui,       behind him, was squeaking: “My lord, my lord, it went in here!”             “Shere Khan does us great honor,” said Father Wolf, but his eyes were very       angry. “What does Shere Khan need?”             “My quarry. A man’s cub went this way,” said Shere Khan. “Its parents have       run off. Give it to me.”             Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter’s campfire, as Father Wolf had said,       and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf knew       that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by. Even       where he was, Shere Khan’s shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of       room, as a man’s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel.            “The Wolves are a free people,” said Father Wolf. “They take orders from       the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man’s       cub is ours—to kill if we choose.”             “Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the       bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog’s den for my fair       dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!”      ",236_2.jpg
520,3,520_3.jpg,"       “And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man’s cub is mine,       Lungri—mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with       the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of       little naked cubs—frog-eater—fish-killer—he shall hunt       thee! Now get hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved       cattle), back thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer       than ever thou camest into the world! Go!”             Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he won       Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in the Pack       and was not called The Demon for compliment’s sake. Shere Khan might have       faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, for he       knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground, and would       fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth growling, and when       he was clear he shouted:            “Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to       this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will come       in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!”             Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf       said to her gravely:            “Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack.       Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?”             “Keep him!” she gasped. “He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry;       yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side       already. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run       off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs       in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little frog. O       thou Mowgli—for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee—the time will       come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.”             “But what will our Pack say?” said Father Wolf.            The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he       marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs are       old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack Council,       which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order that the other       wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs are free to run       where they please, and until they have killed their first buck no excuse       is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one of them. The punishment       is death where the murderer can be found; and if you think for a minute       you will see that this must be so.     ",236_3.jpg
521,0,521_0.jpg,"       Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night       of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council       Rock—a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred       wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack       by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him       sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored       veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who       thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a year now. He had       fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten       and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was       very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over each other in the       center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and       again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully,       and return to his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a mother would push       her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been       overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: “Ye know the Law—ye know       the Law. Look well, O Wolves!” And the anxious mothers would take up the       call: “Look—look well, O Wolves!”             At last—and Mother Wolf’s neck bristles lifted as the time came—Father       Wolf pushed “Mowgli the Frog,” as they called him, into the center, where       he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the       moonlight.            Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the monotonous       cry: “Look well!” A muffled roar came up from behind the rocks—the       voice of Shere Khan crying: “The cub is mine. Give him to me. What have       the Free People to do with a man’s cub?” Akela never even twitched his       ears. All he said was: “Look well, O Wolves! What have the Free People to       do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look well!”      ",236_4.jpg
521,1,521_1.jpg,"       “Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to       Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”             “Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”             “Speak then,” cried twenty voices.            “To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you       when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I       will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile from here,       if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”             There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die       in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog       do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be       accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look       well, O Wolves!”             Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice       when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went       down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and       Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for       he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.            “Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will       come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know       nothing of man.”             “It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may       be a help in time.”      ",236_5.jpg
521,2,521_2.jpg,"       “Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack       forever,” said Bagheera.            Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader       of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and       feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to       be killed in his turn.            “Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of       the Free People.”             And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the       price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.            Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess       at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it       were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the       cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a       child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things       in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm       night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s       claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every       little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his       office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the       sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot       he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that       honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for       it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do. ",236_6.jpg
521,3,521_3.jpg,"       Then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on the       hearth. He saw the husbandman’s wife get up and feed it in the night with       black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white and       cold, he saw the man’s child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside with       earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his blanket,       and go out to tend the cows in the byre.            “Is that all?” said Mowgli. “If a cub can do it, there is nothing to       fear.” So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from       his hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.            “They are very like me,” said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had seen       the woman do. “This thing will die if I do not give it things to eat”; and       he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up the hill he       met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat.            “Akela has missed,” said the Panther. “They would have killed him last       night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the hill.”             “I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!” Mowgli held up the       fire-pot.            “Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and       presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not afraid?”             “No. Why should I fear? I remember now—if it is not a dream—how,       before I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and       pleasant.”             All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping dry       branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that satisfied       him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told him rudely       enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he laughed till Tabaqui ran       away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing.     ",236_7.jpg
522,0,522_0.jpg,"       Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and       crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves.            “Thou art the master,” said Bagheera in an undertone. “Save Akela from the       death. He was ever thy friend.”             Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave       one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black hair       tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made       the shadows jump and quiver.            “Good!” said Mowgli, staring round slowly. “I see that ye are dogs. I go       from you to my own people—if they be my own people. The jungle is       shut to me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will       be more merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood,       I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as ye       have betrayed me.” He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks flew       up. “There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here is a       debt to pay before I go.” He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat       blinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.       Bagheera followed in case of accidents. “Up, dog!” Mowgli cried. “Up, when       a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!”             Shere Khan’s ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for the       blazing branch was very near.            “This cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he had       not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs when       we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down thy       gullet!” He beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the tiger       whimpered and whined in an agony of fear.            “Pah! Singed jungle cat—go now! But remember when next I come to the       Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan’s hide on       my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye will not       kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye will sit       here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were somebodies,       instead of dogs whom I drive out—thus! Go!” The fire was burning       furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right and left round       the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur.       At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps ten wolves that had       taken Mowgli’s part. Then something began to hurt Mowgli inside him, as he       had never been hurt in his life before, and he caught his breath and       sobbed, and the tears ran down his face.            “What is it? What is it?” he said. “I do not wish to leave the jungle, and       I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?”      ",236_8.jpg
522,1,522_1.jpg,"       “I—I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey       People! Faugh!”             A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking       Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly       true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up,       there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross each       other’s path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or       bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at       any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then they would howl       and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People to climb up their       trees and fight them, or would start furious battles over nothing among       themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the Jungle-People could see       them. They were always just going to have a leader, and laws and customs       of their own, but they never did, because their memories would not hold       over from day to day, and so they compromised things by making up a       saying, “What the Bandar-log think now the jungle will think later,” and       that comforted them a great deal. None of the beasts could reach them, but       on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them, and that was why       they were so pleased when Mowgli came to play with them, and they heard       how angry Baloo was.            They never meant to do any more—the Bandar-log never mean anything       at all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea, and       he told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in the       tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection from the       wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him teach them. Of course       Mowgli, as a woodcutter’s child, inherited all sorts of instincts, and       used to make little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came       to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees, considered his play       most wonderful. This time, they said, they were really going to have a       leader and become the wisest people in the jungle—so wise that       everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore they followed Baloo       and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very quietly till it was time       for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was very much ashamed of himself,       slept between the Panther and the Bear, resolving to have no more to do       with the Monkey People.            The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and arms—hard,       strong, little hands—and then a swash of branches in his face, and       then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo woke the       jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk with every       tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled away to the       upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting: “He has noticed       us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People admire us for our skill       and our cunning.” Then they began their flight; and the flight of the       Monkey-People through tree-land is one of the things nobody can describe.       They have their regular roads and crossroads, up hills and down hills, all       laid out from fifty to seventy or a hundred feet above ground, and by       these they can travel even at night if necessary. Two of the strongest       monkeys caught Mowgli under the arms and swung off with him through the       treetops, twenty feet at a bound. Had they been alone they could have gone       twice as fast, but the boy’s weight held them back. Sick and giddy as       Mowgli was he could not help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses       of earth far down below frightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at       the end of the swing over nothing but empty air brought his heart between       his teeth. His escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest       topmost branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a       whoop would fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring       up, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next       tree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green       jungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea,       and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face, and he       and his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and       crashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept       along the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.            For a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew       better than to struggle, and then he began to think. The first thing was       to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys were       going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless to       look down, for he could only see the topsides of the branches, so he       stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing and       wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die. Rann       saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a few hundred       yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He whistled with       surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and heard him       give the Kite call for—“We be of one blood, thou and I.” The waves       of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to the next       tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. “Mark my trail!”        Mowgli shouted. “Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera of the       Council Rock.”             “In whose name, Brother?” Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of       course he had heard of him.            “Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!”             The last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but       Rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust, and       there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the       treetops as Mowgli’s escort whirled along.     ",236_9.jpg
522,2,522_2.jpg,"       Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like or       understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold Lairs       late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli would have       done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about and sang       their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told his       companions that Mowgli’s capture marked a new thing in the history of the       Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks and       canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked up       some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys tried to       imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began to pull       their friends’ tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.            “I wish to eat,” said Mowgli. “I am a stranger in this part of the jungle.       Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.”             Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild pawpaws.       But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much trouble to go       back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and angry as well as       hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the Strangers’ Hunting       Call from time to time, but no one answered him, and Mowgli felt that he       had reached a very bad place indeed. “All that Baloo has said about the       Bandar-log is true,” he thought to himself. “They have no Law, no Hunting       Call, and no leaders—nothing but foolish words and little picking       thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here, it will be all my own       fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle. Baloo will surely beat       me, but that is better than chasing silly rose leaves with the       Bandar-log.”             No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back,       telling him that he did not know how happy he was, and pinching him to       make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but went with the       shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were       half-full of rain water. There was a ruined summer-house of white marble       in the center of the terrace, built for queens dead a hundred years ago.       The domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage       from the palace by which the queens used to enter. But the walls were made       of screens of marble tracery—beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with       agates and cornelians and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up       behind the hill it shone through the open work, casting shadows on the       ground like black velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was,       Mowgli could not help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a       time, to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and       how foolish he was to wish to leave them. “We are great. We are free. We       are wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all       say so, and so it must be true,” they shouted. “Now as you are a new       listener and can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they       may notice us in future, we will tell you all about our most excellent       selves.” Mowgli made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds       and hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the       praises of the Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of       breath they would all shout together: “This is true; we all say so.”        Mowgli nodded and blinked, and said “Yes” when they asked him a question,       and his head spun with the noise. “Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all       these people,” he said to himself, “and now they have madness. Certainly       this is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a       cloud coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I       might try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired.”             That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined ditch       below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how dangerous the       Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run any risks. The       monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and few in the       jungle care for those odds.            “I will go to the west wall,” Kaa whispered, “and come down swiftly with       the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon       my back in their hundreds, but—”             “I know it,” said Bagheera. “Would that Baloo were here, but we must do       what we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace.       They hold some sort of council there over the boy.”             “Good hunting,” said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That       happened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed       awhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,       and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheera’s light feet       on the terrace. The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost without a       sound and was striking—he knew better than to waste time in biting—right       and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli in circles fifty       and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage, and then as Bagheera       tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him, a monkey shouted:       “There is only one here! Kill him! Kill.” A scuffling mass of monkeys,       biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over Bagheera, while five       or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up the wall of the summerhouse and       pushed him through the hole of the broken dome. A man-trained boy would       have been badly bruised, for the fall was a good fifteen feet, but Mowgli       fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and landed on his feet.     ",236_10.jpg
522,3,522_3.jpg,"       “Stay there,” shouted the monkeys, “till we have killed thy friends, and       later we will play with thee—if the Poison-People leave thee alive.”             “We be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake’s       Call. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him and       gave the Call a second time, to make sure.            “Even ssso! Down hoods all!” said half a dozen low voices (every ruin in       India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old       summerhouse was alive with cobras). “Stand still, Little Brother, for thy       feet may do us harm.”             Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and       listening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther—the       yells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera’s deep, hoarse cough as       he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his       enemies. For the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for       his life.            “Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,” Mowgli       thought. And then he called aloud: “To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the       water tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!”             Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new       courage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the       reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the       jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done his       best, but he could not come before. “Bagheera,” he shouted, “I am here. I       climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my feet! Wait my coming, O       most infamous Bandar-log!” He panted up the terrace only to disappear to       the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself squarely on his       haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as many as he could       hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat, like the flipping       strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told Mowgli that Bagheera       had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys could not follow. The       Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just out of the water, while the       monkeys stood three deep on the red steps, dancing up and down with rage,       ready to spring upon him from all sides if he came out to help Baloo. It       was then that Bagheera lifted up his dripping chin, and in despair gave       the Snake’s Call for protection—“We be of one blood, ye and I”—for       he believed that Kaa had turned tail at the last minute. Even Baloo, half       smothered under the monkeys on the edge of the terrace, could not help       chuckling as he heard the Black Panther asking for help.            Kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a wrench       that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch. He had no intention of       losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself once       or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in working       order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the monkeys yelled       in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to and fro, carried       the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even Hathi the Wild       Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of the Monkey-Folk woke       and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their comrades in the Cold       Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the day birds for miles       round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill. The fighting       strength of a python is in the driving blow of his head backed by all the       strength and weight of his body. If you can imagine a lance, or a       battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool,       quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can roughly imagine what Kaa       was like when he fought. A python four or five feet long can knock a man       down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and Kaa was thirty feet long, as       you know. His first stroke was delivered into the heart of the crowd round       Baloo. It was sent home with shut mouth in silence, and there was no need       of a second. The monkeys scattered with cries of—“Kaa! It is Kaa!       Run! Run!”      ",236_11.jpg
523,0,523_0.jpg,"       “By the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli to himself, “but all this       talking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a       man I must become.”             The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there was       a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny raised       patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a Hindu god       in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such as they       sell at the country fairs.            She gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her       hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that he       might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had taken       him. So she said, “Nathoo, O Nathoo!” Mowgli did not show that he knew the       name. “Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new shoes?” She       touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. “No,” she said       sorrowfully, “those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art very like my       Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.”             Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as       he looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he       wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. “What is the       good of a man,” he said to himself at last, “if he does not understand       man’s talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the       jungle. I must speak their talk.”             It was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to       imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little       wild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate it       almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many things       in the hut.            There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under       anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they       shut the door he went through the window. “Give him his will,” said       Messua’s husband. “Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed. If       he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away.”             So Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of the       field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him under       the chin.            “Phew!” said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf’s cubs). “This       is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest of wood       smoke and cattle—altogether like a man already. Wake, Little       Brother; I bring news.”      ",236_12.jpg
523,1,523_1.jpg,"       “All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now, listen.       Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again, for he       is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in       the Waingunga.”             “There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But news       is always good. I am tired to-night,—very tired with new things,       Gray Brother,—but bring me the news always.”             “Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee       forget?” said Gray Brother anxiously.            “Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But       also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.”             “And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,       Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When I       come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of       the grazing-ground.”             For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village       gate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had to       wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had to       learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and about       plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children in the       village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had taught him       to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on keeping your       temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or       fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the knowledge that       it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking       them up and breaking them in two.            He did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he       was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that he       was as strong as a bull.            And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes       between man and man. When the potter’s donkey slipped in the clay pit,       Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their       journey to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for the       potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest       scolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the       priest told Messua’s husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as soon       as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would have to go       out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they grazed. No one       was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he had been       appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off to a circle       that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great fig-tree. It       was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and the barber,       who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the village       hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys sat and talked       in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the platform where a       cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk every night because he       was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree and talked, and pulled at       the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into the night. They told       wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and Buldeo told even more       wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle, till the eyes of the       children sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads. Most of the       tales were about animals, for the jungle was always at their door. The       deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops, and now and again the tiger       carried off a man at twilight, within sight of the village gates.     ",236_13.jpg
523,2,523_2.jpg,"       Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of, had       to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo, the       Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story to       another, and Mowgli’s shoulders shook.            Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua’s son was       a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked, old       money-lender, who had died some years ago. “And I know that this is true,”        he said, “because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he got in a       riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I speak of he       limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal.”             “True, true, that must be the truth,” said the gray-beards, nodding       together.     ",236_14.jpg
523,3,523_3.jpg,"       “It is full time that boy went to herding,” said the head-man, while       Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli’s impertinence.            The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle       and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back at       night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow       themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly       come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds they are       safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But if they       straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes carried off.       Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting on the back of       Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes, with their long,       backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their byres, one by one,       and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to the children with him       that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with a long, polished       bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the cattle by       themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be very careful       not to stray away from the herd.            An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little       ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes       generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing or       basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge of the       plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped from       Rama’s neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother. “Ah,”        said Gray Brother, “I have waited here very many days. What is the meaning       of this cattle-herding work?”             “It is an order,” said Mowgli. “I am a village herd for a while. What news       of Shere Khan?”             “He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for       thee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to       kill thee.”             “Very good,” said Mowgli. “So long as he is away do thou or one of the       four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of       the village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak tree       in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan’s mouth.”             Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while the       buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest things       in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move on again,       and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes very seldom       say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after another, and       work their way into the mud till only their noses and staring china-blue       eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like logs. The sun makes       the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children hear one kite (never       any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead, and they know that if       they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep down, and the next kite       miles away would see him drop and follow, and the next, and the next, and       almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites come       out of nowhere. Then they sleep and wake and sleep again, and weave little       baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying       mantises and make them fight; or string a necklace of red and black jungle       nuts; or watch a lizard basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near       the wallows. Then they sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at       the end of them, and the day seems longer than most people’s whole lives,       and perhaps they make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and       buffaloes, and put reeds into the men’s hands, and pretend that they are       kings and the figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be       worshiped. Then evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes       lumber up out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one       after the other, and they all string across the gray plain back to the       twinkling village lights.            Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and       day after day he would see Gray Brother’s back a mile and a half away       across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day       after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him, and       dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false step       with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would have       heard him in those long, still mornings.     ",236_15.jpg
524,0,524_0.jpg,"       The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the       standing thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half a       mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry them,       crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.            But Mowgli’s plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a big       circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the bulls       down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for he knew       that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in any       condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was       soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the       rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a       long, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and       give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at       the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to the       ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the trees       down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides of the       ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly       straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung over them       would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.            “Let them breathe, Akela,” he said, holding up his hand. “They have not       winded him yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We       have him in the trap.”             He put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine—it was       almost like shouting down a tunnel—and the echoes jumped from rock       to rock.            After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a full-fed       tiger just wakened.            “Who calls?” said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of       the ravine screeching.            “I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock! Down—hurry       them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!”             The herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave       tongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the       other, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up       round them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before they       were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and bellowed.     ",236_16.jpg
524,1,524_1.jpg,"       A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot       tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal’s skin       is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work, and       Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves lolled       out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them.       Presently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with       the Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo       stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct Mowgli       for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of sight as       soon as they saw the man coming.            “What is this folly?” said Buldeo angrily. “To think that thou canst skin       a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger too, and       there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well, well, we will overlook thy       letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one of the rupees       of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.” He fumbled in his       waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to singe Shere Khan’s       whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tiger’s whiskers to prevent       his ghost from haunting them.            “Hum!” said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a       forepaw. “So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and       perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for       my own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!”             “What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the       stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The tiger has       just fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst not       even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo, must       be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one anna       of the reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!”             “By the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the       shoulder, “must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela, this       man plagues me.”             Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan’s head, found himself       sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli       went on skinning as though he were alone in all India.            “Ye-es,” he said, between his teeth. “Thou art altogether right, Buldeo.       Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war       between this lame tiger and myself—a very old war, and—I have       won.”             To do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have taken       his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf who       obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating tigers       was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind, thought       Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would protect       him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see Mowgli turn       into a tiger too.     ",236_17.jpg
524,2,524_2.jpg,"       “Maharaj! Great King,” he said at last in a husky whisper.            “Yes,” said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little.            “I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a       herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to       pieces?”             “Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my       game. Let him go, Akela.”             Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back over       his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible. When he       got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery       that made the priest look very grave.            Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and the       wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.     ",236_18.jpg
524,3,524_3.jpg,"       “Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I am       a wolf. Let us go, Akela.”             A woman—it was Messua—ran across to the herd, and cried: “Oh,       my son, my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a       beast at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee.       Buldeo says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo’s       death.”             “Come back, Messua!” shouted the crowd. “Come back, or we will stone       thee.”             Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in the       mouth. “Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they tell under       the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son’s life. Farewell;       and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly than their       brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!”             “Now, once more, Akela,” he cried. “Bring the herd in.”             The buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly       needed Akela’s yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,       scattering the crowd right and left.            “Keep count!” shouted Mowgli scornfully. “It may be that I have stolen one       of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you well,       children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my wolves and       hunt you up and down your street.”             He turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he looked       up at the stars he felt happy. “No more sleeping in traps for me, Akela.       Let us get Shere Khan’s skin and go away. No, we will not hurt the       village, for Messua was kind to me.”      ",236_19.jpg
525,0,525_0.jpg,"       When the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the horrified       villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a bundle on his       head, trotting across at the steady wolf’s trot that eats up the long       miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew the conches       louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered the story of       his adventures in the jungle, till he ended by saying that Akela stood up       on his hind legs and talked like a man.            The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the       hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf’s cave.            “They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,” shouted Mowgli, “but I       come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.”             Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and her       eyes glowed as she saw the skin.            “I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into this       cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog—I told him that the hunter       would be the hunted. It is well done.”             “Little Brother, it is well done,” said a deep voice in the thicket. “We       were lonely in the jungle without thee,” and Bagheera came running to       Mowgli’s bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and       Mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit, and       pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon it,       and called the old call to the Council, “Look—look well, O Wolves,”        exactly as he had called when Mowgli was first brought there.     ",236_20.jpg
525,1,525_1.jpg,"       Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He       paddled and scrambled about by his mother’s side, and learned to scuffle       out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the two       rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go to sea       to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days, but then       he ate all he could and throve upon it.            The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens of       thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like puppies,       went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old people in the       nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie kept to their own       grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.            When Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight to       their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until she       heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight lines       in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the       youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few hundred       mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and the babies       were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, “So long as you don’t lie in       muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch, and       so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy sea, nothing will       hurt you here.”             Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy       till they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave       carried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little       hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song, and       if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned.            After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the       waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always kept       his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks learning to       use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and out of the       water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps       on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found that he truly       belonged to the water.            Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking       under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a       swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or       standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did; or       playing “I’m the King of the Castle” on slippery, weedy rocks that just       stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like a big       shark’s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that was the       Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get them; and       Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin would jig off       slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.            Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul’s for the deep sea, by       families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,       and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. “Next year,” said Matkah       to Kotick, “you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must learn how       to catch fish.”             They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how to       sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little       nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the long,       rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all over,       Matkah told him he was learning the “feel of the water,” and that tingly,       prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard and get       away.     ",236_21.jpg
525,2,525_2.jpg,"       “It’s horrible,” said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and       steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him all       standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.            “Well done for a yearling!” said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good       swimming. “I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it,       but if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get to       know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come you       will always be driven.”             “Isn’t there any such island?” began Kotick.            “I’ve followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I can’t say       I’ve found it yet. But look here—you seem to have a fondness for       talking to your betters—suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to       Sea Vitch. He may know something. Don’t flounce off like that. It’s a       six-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first,       little one.”             Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own       beach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as       seals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet       of rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and       rock and gulls’ nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.            He landed close to old Sea Vitch—the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled,       fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners       except when he is asleep—as he was then, with his hind flippers half       in and half out of the surf.            “Wake up!” barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.            “Hah! Ho! Hmph! What’s that?” said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next       walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the       next, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction       but the right one.     ",236_22.jpg
525,3,525_3.jpg,"      At the hole where he went in      Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.      Hear what little Red-Eye saith:      “Nag, come up and dance with death!”       Eye to eye and head to head,         (Keep the measure, Nag.)      This shall end when one is dead;         (At thy pleasure, Nag.)      Turn for turn and twist for twist—         (Run and hide thee, Nag.)      Hah!  The hooded Death has missed!         (Woe betide thee, Nag!)        This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought       single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee       cantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the       musk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always       creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real       fighting.            He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but       quite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end of       his restless nose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he pleased       with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could fluff up his       tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as he scuttled       through the long grass was: “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!”             One day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived       with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down a       roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and clung       to it till he lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in the hot       sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a small boy       was saying, “Here’s a dead mongoose. Let’s have a funeral.”             “No,” said his mother, “let’s take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn’t       really dead.”             They took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his       finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they wrapped       him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he opened his       eyes and sneezed.            “Now,” said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into the       bungalow), “don’t frighten him, and we’ll see what he’ll do.”             It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because he is       eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all the mongoose       family is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki was a true mongoose. He       looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to eat, ran all       round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched himself, and       jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.     ",236_23.jpg
526,0,526_0.jpg,"       “Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father. “That’s his way of making       friends.”             “Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.            Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collar and neck, snuffed at his       ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.            “Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’s a wild creature! I       suppose he’s so tame because we’ve been kind to him.”             “All mongooses are like that,” said her husband. “If Teddy doesn’t pick       him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he’ll run in and out of       the house all day long. Let’s give him something to eat.”             They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it immensely,       and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat in the       sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then he felt       better.     ",236_24.jpg
526,1,526_1.jpg,"       “There are more things to find out about in this house,” he said to       himself, “than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall       certainly stay and find out.”             He spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself in       the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and burned it       on the end of the big man’s cigar, for he climbed up in the big man’s lap       to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into Teddy’s nursery to       watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy went to bed       Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion, because he       had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night, and find       out what made it. Teddy’s mother and father came in, the last thing, to       look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow. “I don’t like       that,” said Teddy’s mother. “He may bite the child.” “He’ll do no such       thing,” said the father. “Teddy’s safer with that little beast than if he       had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake came into the nursery now—”      ",236_25.jpg
526,2,526_2.jpg,"       But Teddy’s mother wouldn’t think of anything so awful.            Early in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda       riding on Teddy’s shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled egg.       He sat on all their laps one after the other, because every       well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day and       have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikki’s mother (she used to live in       the general’s house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what to do if       ever he came across white men.     ",236_26.jpg
526,3,526_3.jpg,"       Then Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen. It       was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as       summer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of       bamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. “This is       a splendid hunting-ground,” he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy at       the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing here       and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush.            It was Darzee, the Tailor-bird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful       nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges       with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The       nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.     ",236_27.jpg
527,0,527_0.jpg,"       “What is the matter?” asked Rikki-tikki.            “We are very miserable,” said Darzee. “One of our babies fell out of the       nest yesterday and Nag ate him.”             “H’m!” said Rikki-tikki, “that is very sad—but I am a stranger here.       Who is Nag?”             Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for       from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss—a       horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then       inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag, the       big black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail. When he       had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed balancing       to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind, and he looked       at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake’s eyes that never change their       expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.            “Who is Nag?” said he. “I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon       all our people, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off       Brahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!”      ",236_28.jpg
527,1,527_1.jpg,"       He spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the       spectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part of a       hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute, but it is impossible       for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and though       Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother had fed him on       dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose’s business in life was to       fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom of his cold       heart, he was afraid.     ",236_29.jpg
527,2,527_2.jpg,"       “Well,” said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, “marks or       no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a       nest?”             Nag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in the       grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden meant death       sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get Rikki-tikki       off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it on one side.            “Let us talk,” he said. “You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?”             “Behind you! Look behind you!” sang Darzee.     ",236_30.jpg
527,3,527_3.jpg,"       “Wicked, wicked Darzee!” said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach       toward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach of       snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.            Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose’s eyes grow       red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little       kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and       Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its stroke, it       never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do next.       Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure that he       could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel path near       the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for him.            If you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say that       when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten, he runs off       and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true. The victory is only a       matter of quickness of eye and quickness of foot—snake’s blow       against mongoose’s jump—and as no eye can follow the motion of a       snake’s head when it strikes, this makes things much more wonderful than       any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose, and it made him       all the more pleased to think that he had managed to escape a blow from       behind. It gave him confidence in himself, and when Teddy came running       down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.            But just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust,       and a tiny voice said: “Be careful. I am Death!” It was Karait, the dusty       brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his bite is       as dangerous as the cobra’s. But he is so small that nobody thinks of him,       and so he does the more harm to people.            Rikki-tikki’s eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the       peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family. It       looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly       off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this is an       advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more       dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn so       quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to the back of the head, he would       get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not know. His       eyes were all red, and he rocked back and forth, looking for a good place       to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and tried to run in, but       the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a fraction of his       shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head followed his       heels close.            Teddy shouted to the house: “Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a       snake.” And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy’s mother. His father ran       out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out once       too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake’s back, dropped       his head far between his forelegs, bitten as high up the back as he could       get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and Rikki-tikki was       just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom of his family at       dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose, and if       he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he must keep himself thin.            He went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while Teddy’s       father beat the dead Karait. “What is the use of that?” thought       Rikki-tikki. “I have settled it all;” and then Teddy’s mother picked him       up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved Teddy from       death, and Teddy’s father said that he was a providence, and Teddy looked       on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the fuss,       which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy’s mother might just as well       have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was thoroughly enjoying       himself.            That night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the       table, he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things.       But he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be       patted and petted by Teddy’s mother, and to sit on Teddy’s shoulder, his       eyes would get red from time to time, and he would go off into his long       war cry of “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!”      ",236_31.jpg
528,0,528_0.jpg,"       “But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the       people?” said Nag.            “Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any       mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king and       queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the melon       bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and quiet.”             “I had not thought of that,” said Nag. “I will go, but there is no need       that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man and       his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the bungalow       will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.”             Rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then Nag’s       head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body followed it.       Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw the size of the       big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head, and looked into the       bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his eyes glitter.            “Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on the       open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?” said       Rikki-tikki-tavi.            Nag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the       biggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. “That is good,” said the       snake. “Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may have       that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he will not       have a stick. I shall wait here till he comes. Nagaina—do you hear       me?—I shall wait here in the cool till daytime.”             There was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone       away. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the bottom       of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an hour he       began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep, and       Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which would be the best       place for a good hold. “If I don’t break his back at the first jump,” said       Rikki, “he can still fight. And if he fights—O Rikki!” He looked at       the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too much for him;       and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.            “It must be the head”’ he said at last; “the head above the hood. And,       when I am once there, I must not let go.”      ",236_32.jpg
528,1,528_1.jpg,"       “If I could get up to your nest, I’d roll your babies out!” said       Rikki-tikki. “You don’t know when to do the right thing at the right time.       You’re safe enough in your nest there, but it’s war for me down here. Stop       singing a minute, Darzee.”             “For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki’s sake I will stop,” said       Darzee. “What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?”             “Where is Nagaina, for the third time?”             “On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is       Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.”             “Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?”             “In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes       nearly all day. She hid them there weeks ago.”             “And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the       wall, you said?”             “Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?”      ",236_33.jpg
528,2,528_2.jpg,"       “All in good time,” said she, without moving her eyes. “I will settle my       account with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are       still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a       step nearer I strike.”             “Look at your eggs,” said Rikki-tikki, “in the melon bed near the wall. Go       and look, Nagaina!”             The big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. “Ah-h!       Give it to me,” she said.            Rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were       blood-red. “What price for a snake’s egg? For a young cobra? For a young       king cobra? For the last—the very last of the brood? The ants are       eating all the others down by the melon bed.”             Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one       egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy’s father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy by       the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups, safe       and out of reach of Nagaina.            “Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!” chuckled Rikki-tikki. “The boy       is safe, and it was I—I—I that caught Nag by the hood last       night in the bathroom.” Then he began to jump up and down, all four feet       together, his head close to the floor. “He threw me to and fro, but he       could not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew him in two. I       did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with me.       You shall not be a widow long.”             Nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg lay       between Rikki-tikki’s paws. “Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me the       last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,” she said,       lowering her hood.            “Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go to       the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his gun!       Fight!”      ",236_34.jpg
528,3,528_3.jpg,"       Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach of       her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself       together and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again       and again and again she struck, and each time her head came with a whack       on the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a       watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her, and       Nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head, so that the rustle of her       tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.            He had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came       nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing       breath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and flew       like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When the cobra       runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a horse’s       neck.            Rikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin       again. She headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as he       was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little song       of triumph. But Darzee’s wife was wiser. She flew off her nest as Nagaina       came along, and flapped her wings about Nagaina’s head. If Darzee had       helped they might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered her hood and       went on. Still, the instant’s delay brought Rikki-tikki up to her, and as       she plunged into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to live, his little       white teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down with her—and       very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be, care to follow a       cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and Rikki-tikki never knew       when it might open out and give Nagaina room to turn and strike at him. He       held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to act as brakes on the dark       slope of the hot, moist earth.            Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,       “It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant       Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.”             So he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the minute,       and just as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered again,       and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the hole leg by       leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little shout. Rikki-tikki       shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed. “It is all over,” he       said. “The widow will never come out again.” And the red ants that live       between the grass stems heard him, and began to troop down one after       another to see if he had spoken the truth.            Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was—slept       and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard day’s       work.            “Now,” he said, when he awoke, “I will go back to the house. Tell the       Coppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.”      ",236_35.jpg
529,0,529_0.jpg,"       Toomai of the Elephants           I will remember what I was, I am sick of rope and chain—         I will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs.      I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane:         I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs.       I will go out until the day, until the morning break—         Out to the wind’s untainted kiss, the water’s clean caress;      I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket stake.         I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!        Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in       every way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years, and as he       was fully twenty years old when he was caught, that makes him nearly       seventy—a ripe age for an elephant. He remembered pushing, with a       big leather pad on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was       before the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full       strength.            His mother Radha Pyari,—Radha the darling,—who had been caught       in the same drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks       had dropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag       knew that that advice was good, for the first time that he saw a shell       burst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the bayonets       pricked him in all his softest places. So, before he was twenty-five, he       gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved and the       best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of India. He       had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds’ weight of tents, on the march in       Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of a steam crane       and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a mortar on his       back in a strange and rocky country very far from India, and had seen the       Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had come back again in the       steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the Abyssinian War medal. He       had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and       sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid, ten years later; and afterward       he had been sent down thousands of miles south to haul and pile big balks       of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein. There he had half killed an       insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share of work.     ",236_36.jpg
529,1,529_1.jpg,"       After that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few score       other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to catch wild       elephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly preserved by       the Indian Government. There is one whole department which does nothing       else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and send them up       and down the country as they are needed for work.            Kala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been cut       off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them       splitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps       than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When,       after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across       the hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last       stockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together,       jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go into       that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when the flicker       of the torches made it difficult to judge distances), and, picking out the       biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer him and hustle him       into quiet while the men on the backs of the other elephants roped and       tied the smaller ones.            There was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise Black       Snake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his time to the       charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk to be out of       harm’s way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in mid-air with a       quick sickle cut of his head, that he had invented all by himself; had       knocked him over, and kneeled upon him with his huge knees till the life       went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a fluffy striped thing       on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail.            “Yes,” said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had taken       him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had seen him       caught, “there is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me. He has       seen three generations of us feed him and groom him, and he will live to       see four.”             “He is afraid of me also,” said Little Toomai, standing up to his full       height of four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old, the       eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take his       father’s place on Kala Nag’s neck when he grew up, and would handle the       heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by his       father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.     ",236_37.jpg
529,2,529_2.jpg,"       Petersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been       paying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an       end, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to pay       the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he went back to his       elephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers, and       hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in the       jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that       belonged to Petersen Sahib’s permanent force, or leaned against the trees       with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who were       going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and       ran about.            Big Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and Machua       Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his, “There       goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. ‘Tis a pity to send that       young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.”             Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens       to the most silent of all living things—the wild elephant. He turned       where he was lying all along on Pudmini’s back and said, “What is that? I       did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to rope       even a dead elephant.”             “This is not a man, but a boy. He went into the Keddah at the last drive,       and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that young       calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.”             Machua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and       Little Toomai bowed to the earth.            “He throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is thy       name?” said Petersen Sahib.            Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him,       and Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in       his trunk and held him level with Pudmini’s forehead, in front of the       great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his hands,       for he was only a child, and except where elephants were concerned, he was       just as bashful as a child could be.            “Oho!” said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, “and why       didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal green       corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry?”      ",236_38.jpg
529,3,529_3.jpg,"       The new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted from       time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting his       small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God Shiv, who       once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very soothing       lullaby, and the first verse says:           Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,      Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,      Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,      From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.         All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.      Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all—      Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,      And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!        Little Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each verse,       till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala Nag’s       side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another as is       their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was left       standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put forward       to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the hills. The       air was full of all the night noises that, taken together, make one big       silence—the click of one bamboo stem against the other, the rustle       of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk of a       half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than we       imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept for       some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala Nag was       still standing up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned, rustling in       the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against half the stars       in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away that it sounded no       more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the stillness, the       “hoot-toot” of a wild elephant.            All the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and       their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and       drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and       knotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up       his picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag’s leg chain and shackled that       elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string round       Kala Nag’s leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast. He knew       that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same thing       hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order by       gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking out across the       moonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to       the great folds of the Garo hills.            “Tend to him if he grows restless in the night,” said Big Toomai to Little       Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was just going       to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a little “tang,”        and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as a       cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai pattered after       him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling under his breath,       “Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O Kala Nag!” The elephant turned,       without a sound, took three strides back to the boy in the moonlight, put       down his trunk, swung him up to his neck, and almost before Little Toomai       had settled his knees, slipped into the forest.            There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the       silence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes a       tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the sides       of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would scrape along       his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it. But       between those times he moved absolutely without any sound, drifting       through the thick Garo forest as though it had been smoke. He was going       uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars in the rifts of the       trees, he could not tell in what direction.            Then Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute,       and Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and       furry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist       over the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he       felt that the forest was awake below him—awake and alive and       crowded. A big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupine’s       quills rattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems       he heard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as       it digged.            Then the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go       down into the valley—not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun       goes down a steep bank—in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily       as pistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow       points rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a noise       like torn canvas, and the saplings that he heaved away right and left with       his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank, and great       trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his tusks as he threw       his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway. Then Little Toomai       laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging bough should       sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back in the lines       again.     ",236_39.jpg
530,0,530_0.jpg,"       The grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag’s feet sucked and squelched       as he put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley       chilled Little Toomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of       running water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling his       way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round the       elephant’s legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some       trumpeting both upstream and down—great grunts and angry snortings,       and all the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows.            “Ai!” he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. “The elephant-folk are       out tonight. It is the dance, then!”             Kala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began another       climb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make his path.       That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where the bent       jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many elephants       must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little Toomai looked       back, and behind him a great wild tusker with his little pig’s eyes       glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the misty river.       Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up, with trumpetings       and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on every side of them.     ",236_40.jpg
530,1,530_1.jpg,"       At last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top of       the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an irregular       space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as Little Toomai       could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as a brick floor.       Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their bark was rubbed       away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and polished in the       patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from the upper branches,       and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great waxy white things like       convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But within the limits of the       clearing there was not a single blade of green—nothing but the       trampled earth.            The moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants stood       upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked, holding       his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he looked, more       and more and more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree       trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and he counted again and       again on his fingers till he lost count of the tens, and his head began to       swim. Outside the clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth       as they worked their way up the hillside, but as soon as they were within       the circle of the tree trunks they moved like ghosts.            There were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs       lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears; fat,       slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black calves only       three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young elephants with       their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of them; lanky, scraggy       old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious faces, and trunks like rough       bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred from shoulder to flank with great       weals and cuts of bygone fights, and the caked dirt of their solitary mud       baths dropping from their shoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk       and the marks of the full-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a       tiger’s claws on his side.            They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground       in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves—scores and       scores of elephants.            Toomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag’s neck nothing would       happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild       elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a       tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men that night.       Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking       of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen Sahib’s pet       elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling up the       hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from Petersen       Sahib’s camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that he did not       know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too, must have run       away from some camp in the hills about.            At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest, and       Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the       middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants began to       talk in their own tongue, and to move about.     ",236_41.jpg
530,2,530_2.jpg,"       Two hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his       elephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and       Pudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled       into the camp. Little Toomai’s face was gray and pinched, and his hair was       full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute Petersen       Sahib, and cried faintly: “The dance—the elephant dance! I have seen       it, and—I die!” As Kala Nag sat down, he slid off his neck in a dead       faint.            But, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two hours       he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib’s hammock with Petersen       Sahib’s shooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk, a little       brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him, and while the old hairy,       scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him, looking at him       as though he were a spirit, he told his tale in short words, as a child       will, and wound up with:            “Now, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the       elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and they       will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that       dance-room. They made more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala Nag       took me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!”             Little Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into       the twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed       the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills.       Petersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he had       only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need to look       twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to scratch with       his toe in the packed, rammed earth.            “The child speaks truth,” said he. “All this was done last night, and I       have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where       Pudmini’s leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.”             They looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the       ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to       fathom.            “Forty years and five,” said Machua Appa, “have I followed my lord, the       elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what this       child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is—what can we       say?” and he shook his head.            When they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen       Sahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should have       two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and rice and       salt, for he knew that there would be a feast.     ",236_42.jpg
530,3,530_3.jpg,"       Big Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for       his son and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at them       as though he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by the       blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants, and Little       Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant catchers, the       trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all the secrets of       breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to the other, and they       marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a newly killed       jungle-cock, to show that he was a forester, initiated and free of all the       jungles.            And at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs made       the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too, Machua       Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs—Machua Appa,       Petersen Sahib’s other self, who had never seen a made road in forty       years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he had no other name than Machua       Appa,—leaped to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in the air       above his head, and shouted: “Listen, my brothers. Listen, too, you my       lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This little one       shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the Elephants, as his       great-grandfather was called before him. What never man has seen he has       seen through the long night, and the favor of the elephant-folk and of the       Gods of the Jungles is with him. He shall become a great tracker. He shall       become greater than I, even I, Machua Appa! He shall follow the new trail,       and the stale trail, and the mixed trail, with a clear eye! He shall take       no harm in the Keddah when he runs under their bellies to rope the wild       tuskers; and if he slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant,       the bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him. Aihai! my       lords in the chains,”—he whirled up the line of pickets—“here       is the little one that has seen your dances in your hidden places,—the       sight that never man saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my       children. Make your salute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad,       ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,—thou hast       seen him at the dance, and thou too, Kala Nag, my pearl among elephants!—ahaa!       Together! To Toomai of the Elephants. Barrao!”      ",236_43.jpg

538,1,538_1.jpg," hearth-rug spread out upon the quarter-deck of his schooner the Beauty, in the China Seas. It was a lovely evening, and as his crew lay grouped about him, he favoured them with the following melody:O landsmen are folly!O Pirates are jolly!The soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters, as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of Boldheart, may be more easily conceived than described.It was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave the word, ""Whales!""All was now activity.""Where away?"" cried Captain Boldheart, starting up.""On the larboard bow, sir,"" replied the fellow at the masthead, touching his hat. For such was the height of discipline on board of the Beauty, that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head.""His crew lay grouped around him""",23765_1.jpg
538,2,538_2.png," appeared that the song was a translation of ""For what we are going to receive,"" &c.The chief, imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours, and having the majestic appearance of a fighting Parrot, no sooner understood (he understood English perfectly) that the ship was The Beauty, Captain Boldheart, than he fell upon his face on the deck, and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up, & told him he wouldn't hurt him. All the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror, and had also to be lifted up one by one. Thus the fame of the great Boldheart had gone before him, even among these children of Nature.""Arm-in-arm with the Chief""Turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers, and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal. After dinner the Chief told Captain Boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village, and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there. Apprehensive of treachery, Boldheart ordered his boat's crew to attend him completely armed. And well were it for other commanders if their precautions—but let us not anticipate.",23765_2.png
538,3,538_3.jpg," On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to, she ran up a flag, which he instantly recognized as the flag from the mast in the back-garden at home.""Married the Chief's daughter""Inferring from this, that his father had put to sea to seek his long-lost son, the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger, to inquire if this was so, and if so, whether his father's intentions were strictly honourable. The boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat, and reported that the stranger was The Family of twelve hundred tons, and had not only the captain's father on board, but also his mother, with the majority of his aunts and uncles, and all his cousins. It was further reported to Boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner, and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them. Boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the Beauty, and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day.It was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the Latin-Grammar-Master. That thankless traitor was found",23765_3.jpg

Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.  1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.  1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:  1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" appears, or with which the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org  1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.  1.E.3.

Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.  1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.  1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided that  - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the      address specified in Section 4, ""Information about donations to      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.""  - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm      License.

If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.  1.F.  1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain ""Defects,"" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the ""Right of Replacement or Refund"" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.  1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.  1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.   Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.   Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.  The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S. Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email business@pglaf.org.

Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org   Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

The bark was strong, but presently it seemed to come up of its own accord, and out jumped the queerest little man they had ever seen or even heard of except in make-believe story-books. Buster John dropped his knife, and down it went into the wood-pile. He could hear it go rattling from log to log nearly to the bottom. Sweetest Susan gave a little screech. Drusilla sat bolt upright and exclaimed:—“You all better come en go see yo’ ma. I want ter see ’er myse’f.”But there was nothing to be frightened at. The tiny man had brushed the dust and trash from his clothes, and then turned to the children with a good-humored smile. He was not above four ",23869_3.jpg

Mr. Billy-Goat asked Mr. Dog how he was going to get across.“‘Swim,’ said Mr. Dog.“‘Then I’ll have to bid you good-by,’ replied Mr. Billy-Goat, ‘for I can’t swim a stroke.’“By this time they had arrived at the bank of the creek, and they could hear Mr. Wolf coming through the woods. They had no time to lose. Mr. Dog looked around on the ground, gathered some jan-weed, yan-weed, and tan-weed, rubbed them together, and squeezed a drop of the juice on Mr. Billy-Goat’s horns. He had no sooner done this than Mr. Billy-Goat was changed into a white rock.“Then Mr. Dog leaped into the creek and swam across. Mr. Wolf ran to the bank, but there he stopped. The water was so wide it made tears come in his eyes; so deep that it made his legs ache; and so cold that it made his body shiver.“When Mr. Dog arrived safely on the other ",23869_4.jpg

But one day, as my mother was going out to work she found a hamper basket on the gate-post, and in that basket was a baby. So she carried the baby in the house, gave it something to eat, and then put it on the floor to play with the rest. But as soon as she got out of the yard the baby crawled to the pot where the cooked pumpkin was, and ate and ate until there was no pumpkin left. Of course, the rest of the children had to go hungry. And when my mother came home she had to go hungry, too.“She was very much surprised. She found all the pumpkin gone and the children crying for something to eat, and the stray baby was crying louder than any. She said we were the greediest children she had ever seen.“The next day she cooked two pumpkins, but the same thing happened. The baby went to the pot and ate both.

You’ll turn a chair over directly, and Brother Terrapin will give a jump and fall off the shelf and break some of the furniture in his house.’ This made the girls laugh very much, for they remembered the old saying that Brother Terrapin carries his house on his back. ‘Don’t laugh so loud,’ says I, ‘Brother Terrapin has earned his rest. He’s been courting on the other side of the creek, and he has no carriage to ride in when he goes back and forth. Sh-h!’ says I, ‘don’t disturb him. When a person sits down when he stands up, and lies down when he walks, some allowance must be made.’“Brother Terrapin’s eyes grew redder and redder, and the skin on the back of his head began to work backward and forward. What might have happened I don’t know, but just as the girls were in the middle of a dance one of my fiddle-strings broke, and it was the treble, too.

Drusilla now came forward, and her image stepped forth, looking somewhat scared and showing the whites of its eyes. Mrs. Meadows went to the looking-glass, gave it a sudden turn on its pivots, and carried it into the house.All this happened so rapidly that the children hardly had time to be surprised, but now that the looking-glass had been carried away and they were left with their reflections, their shadows, their images (or whatever it was), they didn’t know what to do, or say, or think. They could only look at each other in dumb astonishment. Drusilla was the first to break the silence. In her surprise she had moved quickly back a few steps, and her image, which had come out of the looking-glass, had as quickly moved forward and toward her a few steps.“Don’t come follerin’ atter me!” she cried ",23869_11.jpg

I can help you, but I can’t be with you.’“Then he found the ivory bobbins, rewound the silver wire, which seemed to spin out still longer, and gave them to Three Wits. ‘Take these,’ he said, ‘and go to the witch’s house.’“‘Do you mean Peggy Pig-Eye’s house?’ asked Three Wits.“‘Why, of course.’ replied the little old man. ‘Her right name, as you saw by the book, is Paggia Paggiola, but people call her Peggy Pig-Eye for short. Go to her house, throw one of the bobbins over the roof, and then throw one around each end. Throw quick and hard, and, as you throw, cry out,—Go hibbity hob hobnobbin.’“‘But wait!’ cried the little old man. ‘You ",23869_16.jpg

And he didn’t run too fast, either, for no sooner had he jumped away than a great hole appeared right where he had been standing. He could see that it was both wide and deep, but he didn’t go back to look at it.“No; he kept on his way, and it wasn’t long before Cob-Handle began to jump and thump. Keen-Point also began to jump and thump, and showed him which way to go, and he ran as fast as he could. He heard a roaring sound as he started, and he had hardly got fifty steps away, though he was running with all his might, before a tremendous whirlwind came along, tearing up the bushes by roots and ploughing the ground. It came so close to Valentine that if he had had on a long-tail coat, I believe it would have been tangled in the whirlwind.“I tell you,” Mrs. Meadows went on, seeing the children smiling, “it was no laughing matter to Valentine. He shivered and trembled ",23869_18.jpg

He had not gone far before he came upon a boat that had drifted into an eddy. It lay there rocking, and a long oar rested against the seat.“‘Jump in,’ said the River; ‘shove the boat away from the bank and trust to me. Take the oar and pull, and I will push you along.’“Valentine did as he was told, and he soon found that the boat was gliding swiftly along. The trees and houses on each side seemed to be running a race to the rear, and the boats that he passed on the River seemed to be standing still. He went on for some hours, always trusting to the River. When he grew tired, he held his oar in the air and rested, but whether he rested or whether he rowed, he saw that his boat was always gliding swiftly along.“Presently, in the far distance, he could see the spires and steeples of a city, and he wondered whether he would be compelled to go gliding by, or whether the River would land him there. But he was not left long in doubt.",23869_19.jpg

556,3,556_3.jpg," ""He's tryin' to git away!"" yelled Forrest in a voice that could be heard all over the field.  And, sure enough, we began to find less and less resistance in front of us, and presently I could see them running out into the valley, filling the road by which we had come.  No pursuit was made at the time, and the Federals, finding that they were not harried, proceeded in a leisurely way toward the river. We followed slowly and at night went into camp, the men and horses getting a good rest. Scouts were coming in to make reports at all hours of the night, so that it was practically true, as one of the old campaigners remarked, that a horse couldn't whicker in the enemy's camp ""but what the General 'd hear it sooner or later.""  Early the next morning we were on the road, and I had time for reflecting that, after all, war was not a matter of flags and music. The General was very considerate, however—a fact that was due to a letter that General Maury had intrusted to Harry Herndon's care. We were permitted to ride as temporary additions to General Forrest's escort, and he seemed to single us out from among the rest with various little courtesies, which I imagined was something unusual.  He was somewhat inquisitive about Whistling Jim, Harry's body-servant, who he thought was a little too free and easy with white men. But he seemed satisfied when Harry told him that the negro's forebears for many generations back had belonged to the Herndons. We halted for a light dinner, and when we had finished General Forrest made a careful inspection of his men as they filed into the road.  We had gone but a few miles when we came to a point where the roads forked. On one he sent a regiment, with Freeman's battery, with instructions to reach the river ahead of the Federals and hold the ford at all hazards until the main body could come up. This done, we swung into the road that had been taken by the Federals and went forward at a somewhat brisker pace.  ""I'm going to give your nigger the chance of his life,"" remarked General Forrest somewhat grimly, ""and he'll either fling up his hands and go to the Yankees, or he'll take to the woods.""  ""He may do one or the other,"" replied Harry; ""but if he does either I'll be very much surprised."" General Forrest laughed; he was evidently very sure that a negro would never stand up before gun-fire. A scout came up to report that the Federals were moving much more rapidly than they had moved in the morning. ",23871_3.jpg
557,0,557_0.jpg," ""I want you to catch this fellow and fetch him to me.""  I tried hard to get out of the difficulty. I protested that I didn't know the scout from a side of sole leather. But the General said that this was one of his reasons for detailing me to perform this duty. He said he would have given it to Jasper Goodrum, of the Independents, but everybody in Tennessee knew Goodrum.  ""He was born and raised around here,"" the General said, ""and he's got a tongue like a bell-clapper. Now, you're not much of a talker, and your face gives you the look of a big baby that has got out of its mammy's yard and don't know how to git back."" I suppose I must have turned red under this back-handed compliment, for he went on, ""I wish I had a thousand like you. I watched you that day on the hill and at the river, and you may put it down that I'll trust you anywhere.""  I tried to thank the General for his confidence, but he stayed me by a gesture. He settled all the details that could be thought of beforehand, and, as I turned to go, he rose from his chair and followed me to the door. ""If you have to shoot that fellow,"" he said, ""do it and don't wait too long before you do it; and if you have to shoot two or three men, don't let that stand in your way—charge 'em up to me. But you must catch that fellow; I want to string him up just to show the balance of 'em that they can't fool with me.""  As everything had been arranged to my hand I was soon going about the camp and the town arrayed in jeans clothes and looking like anything but a soldier. I had thought to surprise Whistling Jim, the negro, with my garb, but, as it turned out, the surprise was mine, for that night, when I went to see whether the horses had been properly groomed and fed, I found the door of the stable unlocked. I was not only surprised but irritated. Both Harry Herndon and myself had tried hard to impress the negro with the necessity of taking unusual precautions to secure the safety of the horses, for they had attracted the attention of the whole camp, which was full of questionable characters, some of whom would have answered to their names if Falstaff had appeared to call the roll of his ragamuffins.  The key had been turned in the lock, but the bolt of the lock had failed to catch in the socket. It was plain that the negro thought he had locked the door, but it was quite as plain that he had been careless, and I made a resolution then and there to look after the safety of the horses myself. I swallowed more than half of my irritation when I found that the horses were in their stalls, warmly blanketed, and an abundance of food before them. I was on the point of locking the door with my own key, when I heard the sound of approaching footsteps. There were two men, civilians, as I judged, and one of them stuttered. Their conversation was of a nature to interest me.  They paused near the door of the stable. ""This is the place where they keep them,"" remarked one of the men. ""They are the finest horses in the rebel army, and it would be a good job to run them into the Union lines some fine night. I know a man that would pay a cracking good price for them.""  ""But the nigger sleeps in there with 'em,"" said the other man, ""and what are you going to do about him?"" ",23871_4.jpg
557,1,557_1.jpg," Whistling Jim ran into him head down like a bull.  I judged that the ruffian had friends among the guests, but when I turned to keep an eye on them the room was clear. Even the landlord had retired. The lad was standing by my side, and my impression is that he was holding me by the sleeve of my coat. I turned to him, and I was more certain than ever that he was either Jane Ryder or her brother. But it was only when she spoke again that I was sure—for not even a twin brother could simulate that round and singularly mellow voice. ""I am afraid you have made matters somewhat hard for me,"" she said, somewhat sadly, ""and heaven knows that I have had trouble enough for one night.""  ""Well, you will have no more trouble here, at any rate,"" I said.  ""I'd feel easier if I were sure of that,"" she remarked.  ""Be assured,"" I answered. ""When I leave this house you will go with me. I propose to take you to your friends, if you have any in the neighborhood; otherwise you go with me. You shall not stay here for that ruffian to abuse and misuse you.""  ""I'll go with you as far as the door if only to thank you for the unnecessary protection you have given me. There are many things that you do not understand.""  ""And many that I do,"" I replied as significantly as I dared. ""I want no thanks, and you shall not remain in this house to-night. That is settled."" She made a birdlike movement with her head and shoulders, looked me up and down, and smiled, but she saw that I was in earnest, and the smile left her face.  ""Where shall I go?"" she asked. ",23871_5.jpg
557,2,557_2.jpg," I was wild with remorse and grief.  ""Come and see,"" I cried. ""The lady has fainted, and she may be dead.""  I went into the room again, and, taking Jane Ryder in my arms, carried her into the next room and laid her on the bed. There was a pitcher of water handy, and I sprinkled her face and began to chafe her cold hands. After what seemed an age, the landlord came cautiously along the hall. ""Call the woman,"" I commanded; ""call the woman, and tell her to come in a hurry.""  This he did, and then peeped in the room, taking care not to come inside the door. ""What is the matter?"" he said uneasily.  ""Can't you see that the lady is ill?"" I answered.  The woman—two women, indeed—came running in response to his summons. ""Go in there and see what the trouble is. See if he has killed her. I told her he was dangerous. You shall pay for this,"" he said, shaking a threatening hand at me, though he came no farther than the door. ""You think she has no friends and that you may use her as you please. But I tell you she has friends, and you will have to answer to them.""  ""Why talk like a fool?"" said the elder of the two women—the woman with whom I had talked in the inner room of the tavern. ""You know as well as I do that this man has not hurt her. If it were some other man I'd believe you. She has only fainted.""  ""But fainting is something new to her. He has hurt her, and he shall pay for it,"" the man insisted. ",23871_6.jpg
557,3,557_3.jpg," ""If hate could kill you, you would fall dead from this horse.""  ""You have a pistol,"" I said—I had felt it against my arm—""and it is easy for you to use it. If you think so meanly of me why not rid the earth of such a villain?""  ""Do you know who I am?"" she asked with a gasp of apprehension.  ""Why, certainly,"" I answered. ""Do you think I'd be taking the trouble to save you else?""  ""Trouble to save me? Save me? Why, I hope your savage General will hang me as high as Haman.""  ""He would if he were a savage,"" I said, ""and he would if you were a man. And he may put you in prison as it is; you would certainly go there if captured by the Forty Thieves. I am taking one chance in a thousand. But better for you to be in prison, where you will be safe, than for you to be going around here masquerading as a man and subjecting yourself to the insults of all sorts of men.""  ""You are the only man that has ever insulted me. Do you hear? You—gentleman!"" she hissed. ""Can't you see that I despise you? Won't you believe it? Does it make no difference?""  ""Not the least in the world,"" I replied. ""Now, you must compose yourself; you can be brave enough when you will—I think you are the bravest woman I ever saw——"" ",23871_7.jpg

When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose. But, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. FezziwigThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.

It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried Hurrah!HE HAD BEEN TIM'S BLOOD-HORSE ALL THE WAY FROM CHURCHThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up, and bring it in.Suppose it should not be done enough!

My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he!

579,1,579_1.jpg,"A BIT OF SUNSHINE.,"" said Kate, as she stood at the door, which she had o-pened to let puss in, ""may I not go out and play? the clouds are all gone and the sun shines bright and warm.""""But the grass must be quite soaked af-ter all the rain,"" said mam-ma. ""I will tell you what to do; run to pa-pa, and ask him if he will not take us to drive.""Pa-pa was just go-ing out, and had his hat in his hand, but he sat down at once to hear what Kate had to say, and prom-ised that he would take ",24692_1.jpg
579,2,579_2.jpg,"them in half an hour, and so Kate ran up-stairs to ask nurse to put her wraps on. By the time the hors-es were at the door she was all read-y, and took her place with great glee.What a bright af-ter-noon it was; the long rain had made all the grass and leaves look bright and green, and they were rust-ling in the fresh breeze. A-way out at sea the ships were fly-ing be-fore the wind, look-ing like great white birds. Kate's home was at the sea-side, and ",24692_2.jpg
579,3,579_3.jpg,"their drive this af-ter-noon would take them for a time on the beach.The waves, pa-pa said, would be ve-ry wild, for the wind was just right to make a heav-y surf. Soon they be-gan to come to the fish-ing vil-lage. The hous-es were small, and on the beach close to each was drawn up a fish-ing boat. On one of these a man was hard at work.

He was down on his knees in his shirt-sleeves, with some sort of a tool in his hands, and was so in-tent on what he was do-ing that he did not raise his head as they passed.In the boat it-self was a boy. He was lean-ing o-ver the side and ",24692_4.jpg
580,1,580_1.jpg,"look-ing down at his fa-ther. His hat had blown off, and he looked like such a nice boy that Kate smiled at him as they went by. He laughed back and made her a lit-tle bow, but the hors-es went by so fast that she saw him for a min-ute on-ly.""What was the name of that boat, pa-pa?"" she asked.""Why, that's a girl's name,"" said Kate.",24692_5.jpg
580,2,580_2.jpg,"""What was the name of that boat, pa-pa?"" she asked.""Why, that's a girl's name,"" said Kate.",24692_6.jpg
580,3,580_3.jpg," Just at that mo-ment they passed by a small house. The door stood wide o-pen, and in it sat a young girl. She had a pil-low in her lap and was work-ing o-ver it, Kate thought, with a nee-dle. ""She is mak-ing lace,"" said mam-ma. ""It is hard work, be-cause one has to sit still bent o-ver. I sup-pose she is glad to have the bright sun-shine to sit in, for no doubt she has been kept in the house by the rain. I won-der if that is her lit-tle broth-er who is lean-ing a-gainst the side of the house whit-tling.""",24692_7.jpg
581,0,581_0.jpg," Kate stretched her head out to look, and cried, ""Why, he is mak-ing a boat; what a clev-er boy! See, the hull is done, and two masts are in place. What fun it would be to have a boat to sail on our lit-tle pond.""""Our pond is too deep for it to be safe for you to play a-bout it,"" said pa-pa; ""but when you are old-er you shall have a boat with-out fail.""The road now left the vil-lage be-hind and ran a-long the top of some high cliffs. At their feet the sea came in in great waves that were topped with foam, and that broke in a mass of spray. There were two or three",24692_8.jpg
581,1,581_1.jpg," per-sons on the beach, and they were walk-ing a-bout and hold-ing up their skirts to keep them from get-ting wet. It looked like such fun that mam-ma asked pa-pa if he would not stop and let her and Kate have a short run on the sands.So the hors-es were brought to a halt, and they got down and made their way through a break in the cliffs to the beach. Then, af-ter they had walked a while, they sat down on a great mass of rock and watched the waves as they rolled and broke at their ",24692_9.jpg
581,2,581_2.jpg," lane. Com-ing to-ward them were a lit-tle girl and boy. They were on their way home from school, as the bag in the girl's hand showed, for it had books in it. As they drew up by the fence to let our par-ty pass, Kate said:""Their mam-ma lets them walk out though the grass is wet; but I would much rath-er ride this way than walk at a-ny time, or play ei-ther, and so would they, I know.""""I am a-fraid the rain is not all o-ver yet,"" said pa-pa. ""That black ",24692_10.jpg
581,3,581_3.jpg," cloud a-head will give us a wet-ting, I fear. I will drive fast-er.""Soon the drops be-gan to fall, but their car-riage had a top, and they had with them rugs, so that they were not hurt at all. Kate, as she peeped out, saw that all were not so safe. A girl and a boy were crouched close un-der a bush by the road-side.""They will not get ve-ry wet,"" said mam-ma, ""for the cloud is near-ly passed by, and the sun shines once more.""""Are we not near home?"" she said ",24692_11.jpg
582,0,582_0.jpg," to pa-pa, ""it is get-ting late, I think. There goes a girl with her pail to drive the cows to the yard to be milked. Kate must have her sup-per when we get back, and her bed-time is sev-en o'clock, you know.""""It is on-ly five now,"" said pa-pa; ""we can have a good hour more, and Kate won't mind, I fan-cy, if she is a lit-tle late for once.""""No, in-deed,"" said Kate; ""I think a-ny way I am get-ting much too big to go to bed at sev-en.""""There is a lit-tle girl,"" said mam-ma, ",24692_12.jpg
582,1,582_1.jpg," as she looked in at the door of a house that they were pass-ing, ""that thinks bed-time is not far off.""""She's on-ly a ba-by,"" said Kate with great in-dig-na-tion, ""and I am quite a large lit-tle wo-man.""Pa-pa and mam-ma both laughed at Kate's tone. She did not like to be laughed at at all, and so, to change the sub-ject, as they went by a house, called out, ""Why, what are that boy and girl do-ing at that hogs-head?""""Fish-ing,"" said pa-pa so-ber-ly.""In a hogs-head!"" said Kate. ""Who ",24692_13.jpg
582,2,582_2.jpg," ev-er caught fish in such a place? No, they must be sail-ing chips. Yes,"" she went on, as she stretched her short neck up as far as she could, ""that is what they are do-ing; I can see the chips.""Just then pa-pa called out, ""What in the world is this com-ing down the road? Whoa! my boys, stead-y,"" he said to his hors-es as they be-gan to prick up their ears. The next min-ute they saw what it was. A dog came to-ward them at full speed, howl-ing with fright, while close at ",24692_14.jpg
582,3,582_3.jpg," his heels was a cat wild with rage. Her ears were laid back, and she meant to catch and scratch the dog if she could. But he was too fleet for her, and as they looked they saw puss give up the chase and climb up on a fence.""Well,"" said pa-pa, ""I think that dog has had a les-son. He will not trou-ble that cat a-gain, I am sure. I won-der what he did to make her so an-gry. Per-haps he teased her kit-tens.""""There,"" said Kate, a few min-utes ",24692_15.jpg
583,0,583_0.jpg," la-ter, ""there is a dog that is not go-ing to be driv-en by a cat. Just look, mam-ma, he wants to get some of that ba-by's sup-per."" Mam-ma looked up, and on the porch of a house saw just what you see in this pic-ture—a fat small boy with a slice of bread and but-ter, while a dog al-most as big as the boy looked on wait-ing for a bite.Just at the side gate of the house stood an old cart half full of hay. It had not been used for some time, and a pair of birds had made their nest ",24692_16.jpg
583,1,583_1.jpg," in it and had two or three young birds, which they were just feed-ing with a worm.""Oh, how sweet!"" cried Kate, ""Pa-pa, dear, do stop a min-ute."" So pa-pa drew in his hors-es, and they watched them for a lit-tle while. The birds did not seem to mind them at all.""There are no bad boys here-a-bout,"" said pa-pa, ""that is ve-ry cer-tain.""""I am quite sure,"" said mam-ma, ""that it must be time for us to be home. The sun is near-ly set-ting.""",24692_17.jpg
583,2,583_2.jpg,"""Yes,"" said pa-pa, ""it is ten min-utes of six. I will take a new way home, and we can be there in a ve-ry short time."" So he turned off in-to a lane close at hand. The hors-es seemed to know that their work was near-ly done, and went on so brisk-ly that just as the hall clock struck six they stopped in front of the door.",24692_18.jpg

Upon the whole, he seemed pleased with Sara.""THE MONKEY SEEMED MUCH INTERESTED IN HER REMARKS.""""But I must take you back,"" she said to him, ""though I'm sorry to have to do it. Oh, the company you  be to a person!""She lifted him from her shoulder, set him on her knee, and gave him a bit of cake. He sat and nibbled it, and then put his head on one side, looked at her, wrinkled his forehead, and then nibbled again, in the most companionable manner.""But you must go home,"" said Sara at last; and she took him in her arms to carry him downstairs. Evidently he did not want to leave the room, for as they reached the door he clung to her neck and gave a little scream of anger.""You mustn't be an ungrateful monkey,"" said Sara. ""You ought to be fondest of your own family. I am sure the Lascar is good to you.""Nobody saw her on her way out, and very soon she was standing on the Indian Gentleman's front steps, and the Lascar had opened the door for her.""I found your monkey in my room,"" she said in Hindustani.

Captain Mago is sent by Hiram King of Tyre, on a voyage to Tarshish (Spain) to procure a supply of silver and other treasure with which to embellish the temple of David, King of the Jews, which was to be erected at Jerusalem. During his absence of several years, he met with innumerable strange and perilous adventures by land and sea.

And little greedy rabbits, who knew no better, ran into it, to have a feast. Directly they were safe in, Puss pulled the string of the bag, and carried them off to her master. The miller's son killed them, and cooked one for dinner; but Puss took away the other, which was a very fine one, and hung it up for their next day's meal.But although their larder was thus provided, early the next day Puss took her bag and went again into the warren, and in the same manner caught two more fine young rabbits. But instead of carrying them home she walked to the king's palace and knocked at the door.PUSS AT THE PALACE.The king's porter asked who was there. ""I have brought a present to the king,"" said Puss. “Please let me see his majesty.”The porter let her in, and when Puss came into the king's presence she made a low bow, and, taking a fine rabbit out of her bag, said, ""My Lord Marquis of Carrabas sends this rabbit to your majesty with his respects.""PUSS MAKES A PRESENT TO THE KING.“I am much obliged to the marquis,” said the king, and he ordered his head cook to dress the rabbit for dinner.",24778_12.jpg

She ordered one of the attendants to give Puss a good cup of cream, which she liked very much; and she went home and told her master all she had done. The miller's son laughed; but every morning Puss caught a rabbit, and carried it to the palace with the same message.Now, in that country there lived a cruel ogre, who used to eat children, so everybody was afraid of him; but nobody could kill him, he was such a giant. One day Puss went to call on him. He received her civilly, for he did not care to eat cats, so Puss sat down, and began to talk:—""I hear,"" she said, ""great Ogre, that you are so clever, that you can turn yourself into any creature you please.""“Yes, so I can,” said the ogre.“Dear me,” said Puss, ""how much I should like to see your ogreship do it.""Then the ogre, who liked to show how clever he was, turned himself into a lion, and roared so loudly that Puss was quite frightened, and jumped out of the way. Then he changed back into an ogre again. Puss praised him a great deal, and then said, ""Can your ogreship become a small animal as well as a large one?""“Oh, yes,” said the vain ogre; and he changed himself into a little mouse. Directly Puss saw him in this form she jumped at him and killed him on the spot.THE MARQUIS OF CARRABAS.",24778_13.jpg

The miller's son obeyed; and while he was in the water, Puss took away all his clothes, and hid them under a large stone. Now, the king's carriage came in sight soon after, just as Puss had expected, for he always drove in that direction, and directly she saw it, she began to cry very loudly, ""Help, help, for my Lord the Marquis of Carrabas."" The king put his head out, and asked what was the matter.PUSS ASKS HELP FOR HIS MASTER.“Oh, your majesty,” said Puss, ""my master the marquis was bathing, and some one has taken away his clothes.

But all had belonged really to the ogre, for it was to his castle the cunning cat had told the coachman to drive.At last the coach stopped at the Ogre's castle, and Puss came out, and bowing very low, said, ""Your majesty and the princess are welcome to the castle of my Lord Marquis of Carrabas.""",24778_15.jpg

There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman had suffered from fever and ague. Jack did no work as yet, and by degrees they grew dreadfully poor. The widow saw that there was no means of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow; so one morning she said to her son, ""I am too weak to go myself, Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her."" Jack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on the way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand.

And Jack was so silly as to consent to this foolish bargain.THE BEAN-STALK GROWS OUT OF SIGHT IN A NIGHT.When he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed many tears, scolding Jack for his folly. He was very sorry; but, he said, he might as well make the best of his bargain, so he put the seed-beans into the ground close by the side of the steep hill under shelter of which their cottage was built, and went to bed. The next morning when he got up, he found that the beans had grown, till the bean stalks reached right over the top of the hill, and were lost to his sight. Greatly surprised, he called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at the bean-stalk, which was not only of great height, but was thick enough to bear Jack's weight.“I wonder where it goes?” said Jack to his mother; ""I think I will climb up and see.""His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jack coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain there must be something wonderful in the bean-stalk.Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-like bean till every thing he had left behind him, the cottage, the village, and even the tall church tower, looked quite little, and still he did not see the top of the bean stalk.Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go back again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way to succeed in anything is not to give up. So after resting for a moment he went on, and at last reached the top of the bean, and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded; and not far from the place where he had got off the bean-stalk stood a fine and strong castle.Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was as much separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood as if it were in another land.While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-looking woman came out of the wood and advanced towards him.",24778_37.jpg

Jack could see quite plainly through a little hole which he had bored in the door. Three times the giant said “Lay,” and each time the hen laid a solid gold egg. Then the Ogre, being drowsy, shut his eyes, and soon snored very loudly. Directly Jack found that the giant was asleep, he stole out of the press, caught up the hen, ran out of the room, opened the door of the castle, which the giant had left ajar, and descended the bean-stalk as fast as he could go. His mother was glad to see him again, and much surprised at seeing the hen, which laid them three gold eggs every day. Jack's mother took them to the next town and sold them, and soon grew quite rich. Some time afterwards Jack made another journey up the bean-stalk to the giant's castle; but first he dyed his hair and disguised himself. The old woman did not know him again, and dragged him in as she had done before to eat him by-and-by; but once more she heard her husband coming and hid him in the press, not thinking that it was the same boy who had stolen the hen.

In a few minutes Jack heard him snore. He directly crept out of the press, seized the bags, and hurrying out of the castle, carried them home quite safely. Jack's mother was glad to see him safe at home again, and for a long time she would not let him go up the bean-stalk; but Jack knew he had not yet obeyed the fairy's command to win back the castle, so after a time he set off once more on this adventure, and tapped again at the castle door.The giantess, who was very stupid, did not know him again, but she stopped a minute before she took him in. She feared another robbery; but Jack's fresh cheeks looked so tempting that she could not resist him, and so she bade him come in.But at that moment she heard her husband's step approaching.Afraid of losing her supper, the Ogress at once shut Jack in the press; and she had hardly hidden him when the giant came in, saying as usual, ""Fee, fa, fie, fo, fum, “I smell the blood of an Englishman.”",24778_41.jpg

Then the Ogre said, “Play,” to the harp, and it played so delightfully that Jack was charmed.JACK TAKES THE TALKING HARP.By-and-by, however, the giant snored so loud that he could not hear the music; and Jack quickly stole out, and seizing the harp, ran away with it. But the harp was a fairy belonging to the giant, and as Jack ran, it cried out, “Master! Master!” The giant woke up slowly and rushed after Jack, but the boy was very nimble and outran him.

602,1,602_1.jpg,"In the days of good king Arthur there lived a countryman and his wife who, though they had plenty to eat and to drink, and a very comfortable cottage to live in, were not at all happy.They had no children, and they both wished very much for a baby. The wife was often in tears when her husband was out at work and she was all alone, because she had not an infant to take care of and nurse. One day, as she sat weeping by herself, more than usually sad, she said aloud, ""If I only had a dear little baby, I should not care what it was like. I should be thankful for one if it were no bigger than my husband's thumbNow it happened that the Queen of the Fairies was passing by, though the poor woman could not see her, and as she knew the farmer's wife was kind to the poor and likely to be a good mother, she thought she would grant her wish.THE FARMER'S WIFE CRYING BECAUSE SHE HAS NO BABY.So about an hour or two afterwards the woman was much surprised to see standing by the table a very beautiful lady, dressed splendidly, with a glittering star on her forehead and a wand in her right hand, with a gem of great brilliancy at the top of it. But what delighted the woman most of all was a tiny cradle, made of a walnut shell, lined with velvet, in which lay the prettiest baby ever seen, but it was only just as large as a man's thumb. “See,” said the fairy, ""your wish is granted. Here is a baby for you. Take care of it; it is your own."" The woman did not know how to thank the fairy enough; she was so delighted, and the queen went away quite pleased at having given so much happiness.",24778_45.jpg

Tom no sooner felt the hot water than he danced about like mad; the woman was nearly frightened out of her wits to see the pudding come out of the pot and jump about, and she was glad to give it to a tinker who was passing that way.

The pudding fell to pieces in the fall, and Tom, creeping out, went home to his mother, whom he found in great trouble, because she could not find him.After this accident, Tom's mother never let him stay near her while she was cooking, but she was obliged to take him with her when she went out milking, for she dared not trust the little man in the house alone.A few days after his escape from the pudding, Tom went, with his mother, into the fields to milk the cows, and for fear he should be blown away by the wind, she tied him to a thistle with a small piece of thread.",24778_48.jpg

The lark's song in the sky was—“Come up, come up, Golden Hair; here is your happy home.”“Coo, I love you; coo, I love you!” cooed the wood-pigeon, as she passed.“Twit, twit, pretty child,” said the sparrow.“Oh, you darling,” sang the blackbird; and Golden Hair laughed with glee, for she liked to be loved.As to the butterflies, they flew after her, and rested on her hair, and tickled her cheeks; but she never tried to catch them.",24778_65.jpg

She would not frighten or vex them for anything. She loved all the creatures, and that is why they loved her.Dear little Golden Hair, she went on singing merrily through the greenwood, saying sometimes to herself—“I wish I could sing as well as the lark!”By-and-by Little Golden Hair reached the Bears' house. She had never seen it before, and she wondered who lived there. A window was open, and Golden Hair peeped in.“Dear me,” thought the child, ""whose house can it be! There is a table and three chairs, and three basins of hot milk, all steaming, and nobody to drink it. But I don't see any work or books, or anything else. I think I will go in and see who lives here.""So she tapped at the door, and cried, “Is any one at home?”But there was no answer. Then Golden Hair stepped in very carefully, and looked about her.",24778_66.jpg

Then Golden Hair stepped in very carefully, and looked about her.She could not see any one, nor hear anybody snoring, so she walked into the Bears' parlour.There was a fire, which made the room cheerful, and the hot milk looked very inviting; it quite seemed to say, ""Come and have some breakfast;"" and the early spring air had made Golden Hair rather cold, and very hungry; so she sat down by the fire in the little Bear's chair. It was too small for her, but she did not quite sit down at first. In a moment she got up again, and went round the table and tasted the milk in all the basins. Little Bear's was the nicest, because it had sugar in it, and Golden Hair thought it was good. So she took the basin and sat down again in Little Bear's chair, took his spoon, and ate up  his milk. Now this was very wrong. A tiny bear is only a tiny bear; still, he has a right to keep his own things. But Golden Hair did not know any better. Unluckily, Baby Bear's chair was, as we have said, too small for her; she broke the seat and fell through, basin and all.GOLDEN HAIR EATS THE LITTLE BEAR'S BREAKFAST.Then Golden Hair went upstairs, and there she saw three beds all in a row. Golden Hair lay down on Father Bear's bed first, but that was too long for her; then she lay down on Mother Bear's bed, and that was too wide for her; last of all she lay down on Baby Bear's bed, and there she fell asleep, for she was tired.",24778_67.jpg

He is very happy playing with them for hours.Sometimes he gets tired of his playthings, and says, ""Mamma, what shall I do now?"" Then his mamma tells him that he may read his lesson. If he has been a good boy, she reads some of the stories in ""The Nursery"" to him, which pleases him very much.One day last autumn, his papa and mamma went over on the Neosho River, in the Indian Territory (you must look",24942_6.png

Of course they took Albert with them.It was a bright sunny morning when they started off across the prairie. They saw a great many prairie-chickens, and two big gray wolves, as they went along. Albert was in great glee; but it was a long ride, and the little boy was very glad when they came in sight of the sparkling waters of the Neosho, just as the sun was setting.Papa had just time to pitch a tent and build a big fire before it was quite dark. Then they all sat down by the fire, and ate their supper. Then mamma made up a nice bed with blankets and shawls, and put Albert into it. They were all glad to go to bed early.The wolves barked at them several times during the night, but were too much afraid of the fire to venture very near. Albert slept as sweetly as if he had been in his own little bed at home, instead of being out under the starry sky, far away from a house. When he opened his eyes next morning, it was yet quite dusk; but papa was getting ready to go to a pond to shoot some ducks for breakfast. Albert wished to go too; and papa kindly consented. When they came to the pond, papa told Albert to sit down on a log a little way off, so that he would not scare the ducks, and wait until he called him.Albert promised to do so, and waited for a while; but it seemed to him a very long time, and he began to grow tired and hungry.

In rushed a stout old nurse from the next room, and seeing Tom likewise, made up her mind that he had come to rob, plunder, destroy, and burn; and dashed at him, as he lay over the fender, so fast that she caught him by the jacket.But she did not hold him. Tom had been in a policeman's hands many a time, and out of them too, what is more; and he would have been ashamed to face his friends for ever if he had been stupid enough to be caught by an old woman; so he doubled under the good lady's arm, across the room, and out of the window in a moment.He did not need to drop out, though he would have done so bravely enough.

But I have brought you a new little brother, and watched him safe all the way here.""Then all the fairies laughed for joy at the thought that they had a little brother coming.""But mind, maidens, he must not see you, or know that you are here.

But the trout were so busy gobbling worms that they never turned to answer him; so that Tom was spared the pain of bidding them farewell.And now, down the rushing stream, guided by the bright flashes of the storm; past tall birch-fringed rocks, which shone out one moment as clear as day, and the next were dark as night; past dark hovers under swirling banks, from which great trout rushed out on Tom, thinking him to be good to eat, and turned back sulkily, for the fairies sent them home again with a tremendous scolding, for daring to meddle with a water-baby; on through narrow strids and roaring cataracts, where Tom was deafened and blinded for a moment by the rushing waters; along deep reaches, where the white water-lilies tossed and flapped beneath the wind and hail; past sleeping villages; under dark bridge-arches, and away and away to the sea.

It was a clear still September night, and the moon shone so brightly down through the water, that he could not sleep, though he shut his eyes as tight as possible. So at last he came up to the top, and sat upon a little point of rock, and looked up at the broad yellow moon, and wondered what she was, and thought that she looked at him. And he watched the moonlight on the rippling river, and the black heads of the firs, and the silver-frosted lawns, and listened to the owl's hoot, and the snipe's bleat, and the fox's bark, and the otter's laugh; and smelt the soft perfume of the birches, and the wafts of heather honey off the grouse moor far above; and felt very happy, though he could not well tell why.

And at last, with his fretting and crying, he grew quite lean and thin.But one day among the rocks he found a playfellow. It was not a water-baby, alas! but it was a lobster; and a very distinguished lobster he was; for he had live barnacles on his claws, which is a great mark of distinction in lobsterdom, and no more to be bought for money than a good conscience or the Victoria Cross.""Tom had never seen a lobster before.""—",25564_7.jpg

""Ah, it is gone!"" And she jumped down off the rock to try and catch Tom before he slipped into the sea.Too late! and what was worse, as she sprang down, she slipped, and fell some six feet, with her head on a sharp rock, and lay quite still.The professor picked her up, and tried to waken her, and called to her, and cried over her, for he loved her very much: but she would not waken at all. So he took her up in his arms and carried her to her governess, and they all went home; and little Ellie was put to bed, and lay there quite still; only now and then she woke up and called out about the water-baby: but no one knew what she meant, and the professor did not tell, for he was ashamed to tell.And, after a week, one moonlight night, the fairies came flying in at the window and brought her such a pretty pair of wings that she could not help putting them on; and she flew with them out of the window, and over the land, and over the sea, and up through the clouds, and nobody heard or saw anything of her for a very long while.And this is why they say that no one has ever yet seen a water-baby.

And when it saw Tom it looked up for a moment, and then cried, ""Why, you are not one of us. You are a new baby!

And there he taught the water-babies for a great many hundred years, till his eyes grew too dim to see, and his beard grew so long that he dared not walk for fear of treading on it, and then he might have tumbled down.

And Tom turned away northward, sad and wondering; and watched the great steamer slide away into the dusk, and the lights on board peep out one by one, and die out again, and the long bar of smoke fade away into the evening mist, till all was out of sight.And he swam northward again, day after day, till at last he met the King of the Herrings, with a curry-comb growing out of his nose, and a sprat in his mouth for a cigar, and asked him the way to Shiny Wall; so he bolted his sprat head foremost, and said:""If I were you, young gentleman, I should go to the Allalonestone, and ask the last of the Gairfowl.

The dog snapped at them till his jaws were tired; but Tom hardly minded them at all, he was so eager to get to the top of the water, and see the pool where the good whales go.And a very large pool it was, miles and miles across, though the air was so clear that the ice cliffs on the opposite side looked as if they were close at hand. All round it the ice cliffs rose, in walls and spires and battlements, and caves and bridges, and stories and galleries, in which the ice-fairies live, and drive away the storms and clouds, that Mother Carey's pool may lie calm from year's end to year's end. And the sun acted policeman, and walked round outside every day, peeping just over the top of the ice wall, to see that all went right; and now and then he played conjuring tricks, or had an exhibition of fireworks, to amuse the ice-fairies. For he would make himself into four or five suns at once, or paint the sky with rings and crosses and crescents of white fire, and stick himself in the middle of them, and wink at the fairies; and I daresay they were very much amused; for anything's fun in the country.And there the good whales lay, the happy sleepy beasts, upon the still oily sea.

640,1,640_1.jpg,"Here is a story with a boy hero, and a boy of whom you have never before heard. There are girls in the story, too, including our old friend Dorothy, and some of the characters wander a good way from the Land of Oz before they all assemble in the Emerald City to take part in Ozma's banquet. Indeed, I think you will find this story quite different from the other histories of Oz, but I hope you will not like it the less on that account.If I am permitted to write another Oz book it will tell of some thrilling adventures encountered by Dorothy, Betsy Bobbin, Trot and the Patchwork Girl right in the Land of Oz, and how they discovered some amazing creatures that never could have existed outside a fairyland. I have an idea that about the time you are reading this story of Rinkitink I shall be writing that story of Adventures in Oz.Don't fail to write me often and give me your advice and suggestions, which I always appreciate. I get a good many letters from my readers, but every one is a joy to me and I answer them as soon as I can find time to do so. Royal Historian of Oz",25581_1.jpg
640,2,640_2.jpg,"All that forenoon the fog continued. King Kitticut, who sat in his palace talking with his merry visitor, ordered the candles lighted, that they might be able to see one another. The good Queen, Inga's mother, found it was too dark to work at her embroidery, so she called her maidens together and told them wonderful stories of bygone days, in order to pass away the dreary hours.But soon after noon the weather changed. The dense fog rolled away like a heavy cloud and suddenly the sun shot his bright rays over the island.""Very good!"" exclaimed King Kitticut. ""We shall have a pleasant afternoon, I am sure,"" and he blew out the candles.Then he stood a moment motionless, as if turned to stone, for a terrible cry from without the palace reached his ears—a cry so full of fear and horror that the King's heart almost stopped beating. Immediately there was a scurrying of feet as every one in the palace, filled with dismay, rushed outside to see what had happened. Even fat little Rinkitink sprang from his chair and followed his host and the others through the arched vestibule.After many years the worst fears of King Kitticut were realized.Landing upon the beach, which was but a few steps from the palace itself, were hundreds of boats, every one filled with a throng of fierce warriors. They sprang upon the land with wild shouts of defiance and rushed to the King's palace, waving aloft their swords and spears and battle-axes.King Kitticut, so completely surprised that he was bewildered, gazed at the approaching host with terror and grief.""They are the men of Regos and Coregos!"" he groaned. ""We are, indeed, lost!""Then he bethought himself, for the first time, of his wonderful pearls. Turning quickly, he ran back into the palace and hastened to the hall where the treasures were hidden. But the leader of the warriors had seen the King enter the palace and bounded after him, thinking he meant to escape. Just as the King had stooped to press the secret spring in the tiles, the warrior seized him from the rear and threw him backward upon the floor, at the same time shouting to his men to fetch ropes and bind the prisoner. This they did very quickly and King Kitticut soon found himself helplessly bound and in the power of his enemies. In this sad condition he was lifted by the warriors and carried outside, when the good King looked upon a sorry sight.The Queen and her maidens, the officers and servants of the royal household and all who had inhabited this end of the Island of Pingaree had been seized by the invaders and bound with ropes. At once they began carrying their victims to the boats, tossing them in as unceremoniously as if they had been bales of merchandise.The King looked around for his son Inga, but failed to find the boy among the prisoners. Nor was the fat King, Rinkitink, to be seen anywhere about.The warriors were swarming over the palace like bees in a hive, seeking anyone who might be in hiding, and after the search had been prolonged for some time the leader asked impatiently: ""Do you find anyone else?""""No,"" his men told him. ""We have captured them all.""",25581_2.jpg
640,3,640_3.jpg,"""I have heard no music, as yet,"" declared the goat. ""You must have a strong imagination, King Rinkitink, if you consider your songs music. Do you remember the story of the bear that hired out for a nursemaid?""""I do not recall it just now,"" said Rinkitink, with a wink at Inga.""Well, the bear tried to sing a lullaby to put the baby to sleep.""""And then?"" said the King.""The bear was highly pleased with its own voice, but the baby was nearly frightened to death.""""Heh, heh, heh, heh, whoo, hoo, hoo! You are a merry rogue, Bilbil,"" laughed the King; ""a merry rogue in spite of your gloomy features. However, if I have not amused you, I have at least pleased myself, for I am exceedingly fond of a good song. So let us say no more about it.""All this time the boy Prince was rowing the boat. He was not in the least tired, for the oars he held seemed to move of their own accord. He paid little heed to the conversation of Rinkitink and the goat, but busied his thoughts with plans of what he should do when he reached the islands of Regos and Coregos and confronted his enemies. When the others finally became silent, Inga inquired:""Can you fight, King Rinkitink?""""I have never tried,"" was the answer. ""In time of danger I have found it much easier to run away than to face the foe."" you fight?"" asked the boy.""I might try, if there was no chance to escape by running. Have you a proper weapon for me to fight with?""""I have no weapon at all,"" confessed Inga.""Then let us use argument and persuasion instead of fighting. For instance, if we could persuade the warriors of Regos to lie down, and let me step on them, they would be crushed with ease.""Prince Inga had expected little support from the King, so he was not discouraged by this answer. After all, he reflected, a conquest by battle would be out of the question, yet the White Pearl would not have advised him to go to Regos and Coregos had the mission been a hopeless one. It seemed to him, on further reflection, that he must rely upon circumstances to determine his actions when he reached the islands of the barbarians.By this time Inga felt perfect confidence in the Magic Pearls. It was the White Pearl that had given him the boat, and the Blue Pearl that had given him strength to row it. He believed that the Pink Pearl would protect him from any danger that might arise; so his anxiety was not for himself, but for his companions. King Rinkitink and the goat had no magic to protect them, so Inga resolved to do all in his power to keep them from harm.For three days and three nights the boat with the silver lining sped swiftly over the ocean. On the morning of the fourth day, so quickly had they traveled, Inga saw before him the shores of the two great islands of Regos and Coregos.",25581_3.jpg
641,0,641_0.jpg,"""King Rinkitink,"" said he, ""do you know what has become of my left shoe?""""Your shoe!"" exclaimed the King, giving a wide yawn and rubbing his eyes to get the sleep out of them. ""Have you lost a shoe?""""Yes,"" said Inga. ""I have searched everywhere in the room, and cannot find it.""""But why bother me about such a small thing?"" inquired Rinkitink. ""A shoe is only a shoe, and you can easily get another one. But, stay! Perhaps it was your shoe which I threw at the cat last night.""""The cat!"" cried Inga. ""What do you mean?""""Why, in the night,"" explained Rinkitink, sitting up and beginning to dress himself, ""I was wakened by the mewing of a cat that sat upon a wall of the palace, just outside my window. As the noise disturbed me, I reached out in the dark and caught up something and threw it at the cat, to frighten the creature away. I did not know what it was that I threw, and I was too sleepy to care; but probably it was your shoe, since it is now missing.""""Then,"" said the boy, in a despairing tone of voice, ""your carelessness has ruined me, as well as yourself, King Rinkitink, for in that shoe was concealed the magic power which protected us from danger.""The King's face became very serious when he heard this and he uttered a low whistle of surprise and regret.""Why on earth did you not warn me of this?"" he demanded. ""And why did you keep such a precious power in an old shoe? And why didn't you put the shoe under a pillow? You were very wrong, my lad, in not confiding to me, your faithful friend, the secret, for in that case the shoe would not now be lost.""To all this Inga had no answer. He sat on the side of his bed, with hanging head, utterly disconsolate, and seeing this, Rinkitink had pity for his sorrow.""Come!"" cried the King; ""let us go out at once and look for the shoe which I threw at the cat. It must even now be lying in the yard of the palace.""This suggestion roused the boy to action. He at once threw open the door and in his stocking feet rushed down the staircase, closely followed by Rinkitink. But although they looked on both sides of the palace wall and in every possible crack and corner where a shoe might lodge, they failed to find it.After a half hour's careful search the boy said sorrowfully:""Someone must have passed by, as we slept, and taken the precious shoe, not knowing its value. To us, King Rinkitink, this will be a dreadful misfortune, for we are surrounded by dangers from which we have now no protection. Luckily I have the other shoe left, within which is the magic power that gives me strength; so all is not lost.""Then he told Rinkitink, in a few words, the secret of the wonderful pearls, and how he had recovered them from the ruins and hidden them in his shoes, and how they had enabled him to drive King Gos and his men from Regos and to capture the city. The King was much astonished, and when the story was concluded he said to Inga:",25581_4.jpg
641,1,641_1.jpg,"You may be sure the Queen of Coregos was not well pleased to have King Gos and all his warriors living in her city after they had fled from their own. They were savage natured and quarrelsome men at all times, and their tempers had not improved since their conquest by the Prince of Pingaree. Moreover, they were eating up Queen Cor's provisions and crowding the houses of her own people, who grumbled and complained until their Queen was heartily tired.""Shame on you!"" she said to her husband, King Gos, ""to be driven out of your city by a boy, a roly-poly King and a billy goat! Why do you not go back and fight them?""""No human can fight against the powers of magic,"" returned the King in a surly voice. ""That boy is either a fairy or under the protection of fairies. We escaped with our lives only because we were quick to run away; but, should we return to Regos, the same terrible power that burst open the city gates would crush us all to atoms.""""Bah! you are a coward,"" cried the Queen, tauntingly.""I am not a coward,"" said the big King. ""I have killed in battle scores of my enemies; by the might of my sword and my good right arm I have conquered many nations; all my life people have feared me. But no one would dare face the tremendous power of the Prince of Pingaree, boy though he is. It would not be courage, it would be folly, to attempt it.""""Then meet his power with cunning,"" suggested the Queen. ""Take my advice, and steal over to Regos at night, when it is dark, and capture or destroy the boy while he sleeps.""""No weapon can touch his body,"" was the answer. ""He bears a charmed life and cannot be injured.""""Does the fat King possess magic powers, or the goat?"" inquired Cor.""I think not,"" said Gos. ""We could not injure them, indeed, any more than we could the boy, but they did not seem to have any unusual strength, although the goat's head is harder than a battering-ram.""""Well,"" mused the Queen, ""there is surely some way to conquer that slight boy. If you are afraid to undertake the job, I shall go myself. By some strategem I shall manage to make him my prisoner. He will not dare to defy a Queen and no magic can stand against a woman's cunning.""""Go ahead, if you like,"" replied the King, with an evil grin, ""and if you are hung up by the thumbs or cast into a dungeon, it will serve you right for thinking you can succeed where a skilled warrior dares not make the attempt.""""I'm not afraid,"" answered the Queen. ""It is only soldiers and bullies who are cowards.""In spite of this assertion, Queen Cor was not so brave as she was cunning. For several days she thought over this plan and that, and tried to decide which was most likely to succeed. She had never seen the boy Prince but had heard so many tales of him from the defeated warriors, and especially from Captain Buzzub, that she had learned to respect his power.Spurred on by the knowledge that she would never get rid of her unwelcome guests until Prince Inga was overcome and Regos regained for King Gos, the Queen of Coregos finally decided to trust to luck and her native wit to defeat a simple-minded boy, however powerful he might be. Inga could not suspect what she was going to do, because she did not know herself. She intended to act boldly and trust to chance to win.",25581_5.jpg
641,2,641_2.jpg,"Our story must now return to one of our characters whom we have been forced to neglect. The temper of Bilbil the goat was not sweet under any circumstances, and whenever he had a grievance he was inclined to be quite grumpy. So, when his master settled down in the palace of King Gos for a quiet life with the boy Prince, and passed his time in playing checkers and eating and otherwise enjoying himself, he had no use whatever for Bilbil, and shut the goat in an upstairs room to prevent his wandering through the city and quarreling with the citizens. But this Bilbil did not like at all. He became very cross and disagreeable at being left alone and he did not speak nicely to the servants who came to bring him food; therefore those people decided not to wait upon him any more, resenting his conversation and not liking to be scolded by a lean, scraggly goat, even though it belonged to a conqueror. The servants kept away from the room and Bilbil grew more hungry and more angry every hour. He tried to eat the rugs and ornaments, but found them not at all nourishing. There was no grass to be had unless he escaped from the palace.When Queen Cor came to capture Inga and Rinkitink, both the prisoners were so filled with despair at their own misfortune that they gave no thought whatever to the goat, who was left in his room. Nor did Bilbil know anything of the changed fortunes of his comrades until he heard shouts and boisterous laughter in the courtyard below. Looking out of a window, with the intention of rebuking those who dared thus to disturb him, Bilbil saw the courtyard quite filled with warriors and knew from this that the palace had in some way again fallen into the hands of the enemy.Now, although Bilbil was often exceedingly disagreeable to King Rinkitink, as well as to the Prince, and sometimes used harsh words in addressing them, he was intelligent enough to know them to be his friends, and to know that King Gos and his people were his foes. In sudden anger, provoked by the sight of the warriors and the knowledge that he was in the power of the dangerous men of Regos, Bilbil butted his head against the door of his room and burst it open. Then he ran to the head of the staircase and saw King Gos coming up the stairs followed by a long line of his chief captains and warriors.The goat lowered his head, trembling with rage and excitement, and just as the King reached the top stair the animal dashed forward and butted His Majesty so fiercely that the big and powerful King, who did not expect an attack, doubled up and tumbled backward. His great weight knocked over the man just behind him and he in turn struck the next warrior and upset him, so that in an instant the whole line of Bilbil's foes was tumbling heels over head to the bottom of the stairs, where they piled up in a heap, struggling and shouting and in the mix-up hitting one another with their fists, until every man of them was bruised and sore.Finally King Gos scrambled out of the heap and rushed up the stairs again, very angry indeed. Bilbil was ready for him and a second time butted the King down the stairs; but now the goat also lost his balance and followed the King, landing full upon the confused heap of soldiers. Then he kicked out so viciously with his heels that he soon freed himself and dashed out of the doorway of the palace.""Stop him!"" cried King Gos, running after.But the goat was now so wild and excited that it was not safe for anyone to stand in his way. None of the men were armed and when one or two tried to head off the goat, Bilbil sent them sprawling upon the ground. Most of the warriors, however, were wise enough not to attempt to interfere with his flight.Coursing down the street, Bilbil found himself approaching the bridge of boats and without pausing to think where it might lead him he crossed over and proceeded on his way. A few moments later a great stone building blocked his path. It was the palace of Queen Cor, and seeing the gates of the courtyard standing wide open, Bilbil rushed through them without slackening his speed.",25581_6.jpg
641,3,641_3.jpg,"Then he learned that King Kitticut had indeed been working in this very cavern until the evening before, when King Gos had come and taken him away—still loaded with chains.""Seems to me,"" said King Rinkitink, when he heard this report, ""that Gos has carried your father away to Regos, to prevent us from rescuing him. He may hide poor Kitticut in a dungeon, where we cannot find him.""""Perhaps you are right,"" answered the boy, ""but I am determined to find him, wherever he may be.""Ingo spoke firmly and with courage, but he was greatly disappointed to find that King Gos had been before him at the mines and had taken his father away. However, he tried not to feel disheartened, believing he would succeed in the end, in spite of all opposition. Turning to the guards, he said:""Remove the chains from these slaves and set them free.""The guards laughed at this order, and one of them brought forward a handful of chains, saying: ""His Majesty has commanded us to make you, also, a slave, for you are never to leave these caverns again.""Then he attempted to place the chains on Inga, but the boy indignantly seized them and broke them apart as easily as if they had been cotton cords. When a dozen or more of the guards made a dash to capture him, the Prince swung the end of the chain like a whip and drove them into a corner, where they cowered and begged for mercy.Stories of the marvelous strength of the boy Prince had already spread to the mines of Regos, and although King Gos had told them that Inga had been deprived of all his magic power, the guards now saw this was not true, so they deemed it wise not to attempt to oppose him.The chains of the slaves had all been riveted fast to their ankles and wrists, but Inga broke the bonds of steel with his hands and set the poor men free—not only those from Pingaree but all who had been captured in the many wars and raids of King Gos. They were very grateful, as you may suppose, and agreed to support Prince Inga in whatever action he commanded.He led them to the middle cavern, where all the guards and overseers fled in terror at his approach, and soon he had broken apart the chains of the slaves who had been working in that part of the mines. Then they approached the first cavern and liberated all there.The slaves had been treated so cruelly by the servants of King Gos that they were eager to pursue and slay them, in revenge; but Inga held them back and formed them into companies, each company having its own leader. Then he called the leaders together and instructed them to march in good order along the path to the City of Regos, where he would meet them and tell them what to do next.They readily agreed to obey him, and, arming themselves with iron bars and pick-axes which they brought from the mines, the slaves began their march to the city.Zella at first wished to be left behind, that she might make her way to her own home, but neither Rinkitink nor Inga thought it was safe for her to wander alone through the forest, so they induced her to return with them to the city.The boy beached his boat this time at the same place as when he first landed at Regos, and while many of the warriors stood on the shore and before the walls of the city, not one of them attempted to interfere with the boy in any way. Indeed, they seemed uneasy and anxious, and when Inga met Captain Buzzub the boy asked if anything had happened in his absence.",25581_7.jpg
642,0,642_0.jpg,"The Kingdom of the Nomes does not border on the Nonestic Ocean, from which it is separated by the Kingdom of Rinkitink and the Country of the Wheelers, which is a part of the Land of Ev. Rinkitink's country is separated from the country of the Nomes by a row of high and steep mountains, from which it extends to the sea. The Country of the Wheelers is a sandy waste that is open on one side to the Nonestic Ocean and on the other side has no barrier to separate it from the Nome Country, therefore it was on the coast of the Wheelers that King Gos landed—in a spot quite deserted by any of the curious inhabitants of that country.The Nome Country is very large in extent, and is only separated from the Land of Oz, on its eastern borders, by a Deadly Desert that cannot be crossed by mortals, unless they are aided by the fairies or by magic.The nomes are a numerous and mischievous people, living in underground caverns of wide extent, connected one with another by arches and passages. The word ""nome"" means ""one who knows,"" and these people are so called because they know where all the gold and silver and precious stones are hidden in the earth—a knowledge that no other living creatures share with them. The nomes are busy people, constantly digging up gold in one place and taking it to another place, where they secretly bury it, and perhaps this is the reason they alone know where to find it. The nomes were ruled, at the time of which I write, by a King named Kaliko.King Gos had expected to be pursued by Inga in his magic boat, so he made all the haste possible, urging his forty rowers to their best efforts night and day. To his joy he was not overtaken but landed on the sandy beach of the Wheelers on the morning of the eighth day.The forty rowers were left with the boat, while Queen Cor and King Gos, with their royal prisoners, who were still chained, began the journey to the Nome King.It was not long before they passed the sands and reached the rocky country belonging to the nomes, but they were still a long way from the entrance to the underground caverns in which lived the Nome King. There was a dim path, winding between stones and boulders, over which the walking was quite difficult, especially as the path led up hills that were small mountains, and then down steep and abrupt slopes where any misstep might mean a broken leg. Therefore it was the second day of their journey before they climbed halfway up a rugged mountain and found themselves at the entrance of the Nome King's caverns.On their arrival, the entrance seemed free and unguarded, but Gos and Cor had been there before, and they were too wise to attempt to enter without announcing themselves, for the passage to the caves was full of traps and pitfalls. So King Gos stood still and shouted, and in an instant they were surrounded by a group of crooked nomes, who seemed to have sprung from the ground.One of these had very long ears and was called The Long-Eared Hearer. He said: ""I heard you coming early this morning.""Another had eyes that looked in different directions at the same time and were curiously bright and penetrating. He could look over a hill or around a corner and was called The Lookout. Said he: ""I saw you coming yesterday.""""Then,"" said King Gos, ""perhaps King Kaliko is expecting us.""""It is true,"" replied another nome, who wore a gold collar around his neck and carried a bunch of golden keys. ""The mighty Nome King expects you, and bids you follow me to his presence.""With this he led the way into the caverns and Gos and Cor followed, dragging their weary prisoners with them, for poor King Kitticut and his gentle Queen had been obliged to carry, all through the tedious journey, the bags of gold and jewels which were to bribe the Nome King to accept them as slaves.Through several long passages the guide led them and at last they entered a small cavern which was beautifully decorated and set with rare jewels that flashed from every part of the wall, floor and ceiling. This was a waiting-room for visitors, and there their guide left them while he went to inform King Kaliko of their arrival.Before long they were ushered into a great domed chamber, cut from the solid rock and so magnificent that all of them—the King and Queen of Pingaree and the King and Queen of Regos and Coregos—drew long breaths of astonishment and opened their eyes as wide as they could.In an ivory throne sat a little round man who had a pointed beard and hair that rose to a tall curl on top of his head. He was dressed in silken robes, richly embroidered, which had large buttons of cut rubies. On his head was a diamond crown and in his hand he held a golden sceptre with a big jeweled ball at one end of it. This was Kaliko, the King and ruler of all the nomes. He nodded pleasantly enough to his visitors and said in a cheery voice:",25581_8.jpg
642,1,642_1.jpg,"Inga's heart sank within him as he realized the terrible obstacle placed by the cunning Nome King between him and the safety of the other caverns. There was no turning back, for it would be impossible for him again to leap over the gulf of the second cave, the corridor at this side being so crooked that he could get no run before he jumped. Neither could he leap over the glowing coals of the cavern that faced him, for it was much larger than the middle cavern. In this dilemma he feared his great strength would avail him nothing and he bitterly reproached himself for parting with the Pink Pearl, which would have preserved him from injury.However, it was not in the nature of Prince Inga to despair for long, his past adventures having taught him confidence and courage, sharpened his wits and given him the genius of invention. He sat down and thought earnestly on the means of escape from his danger and at last a clever idea came to his mind. This is the way to get ideas: never to let adverse circumstances discourage you, but to believe there is a way out of every difficulty, which may be found by earnest thought.There were many points and projections of rock in the walls of the crooked corridor in which Inga stood and some of these rocks had become cracked and loosened, although still clinging to their places. The boy picked out one large piece, and, exerting all his strength, tore it away from the wall. He then carried it to the cavern and tossed it upon the burning coals, about ten feet away from the end of the passage. Then he returned for another fragment of rock, and wrenching it free from its place, he threw it ten feet beyond the first one, toward the opposite side of the cave. The boy continued this work until he had made a series of stepping-stones reaching straight across the cavern to the dark passageway beyond, which he hoped would lead him back to safety if not to liberty.When his work had been completed, Inga did not long hesitate to take advantage of his stepping-stones, for he knew his best chance of escape lay in his crossing the bed of coals before the rocks became so heated that they would burn his feet. So he leaped to the first rock and from there began jumping from one to the other in quick succession. A withering wave of heat at once enveloped him, and for a time he feared he would suffocate before he could cross the cavern; but he held his breath, to keep the hot air from his lungs, and maintained his leaps with desperate resolve.Then, before he realized it, his feet were pressing the cooler rocks of the passage beyond and he rolled helpless upon the floor, gasping for breath. His skin was so red that it resembled the shell of a boiled lobster, but his swift motion had prevented his being burned, and his shoes had thick soles, which saved his feet.After resting a few minutes, the boy felt strong enough to go on. He went to the end of the passage and found that the rock door by which he had left his room was still closed, so he returned to about the middle of the corridor and was thinking what he should do next, when suddenly the solid rock before him began to move and an opening appeared through which shone a brilliant light. Shielding his eyes, which were somewhat dazzled, Inga sprang through the opening and found himself in one of the Nome King's inhabited caverns, where before him stood King Kaliko, with a broad grin upon his features, and Klik, the King's chamberlain, who looked surprised, and King Rinkitink seated astride Bilbil the goat, both of whom seemed pleased that Inga had rejoined them.",25581_9.jpg
642,2,642_2.jpg," ""It's very queer how big an earIs worn by Mr. Donkey; And yet I fear he could not hearIf it were on a monkey. 'Tis thick and strong and broad and longAnd also very hairy; It's quite becoming to our HankBut might disgrace a fairy!""This song was received with so much enthusiasm that Rinkitink was prevailed upon to sing another. They gave him a little time to compose the rhyme, which he declared would be better if he could devote a month or two to its composition, but the sentiment he expressed was so admirable that no one criticized the song or the manner in which the jolly little King sang it.Dorothy wrote down the words on a piece of paper, and here they are:""We're merry comrades all, to-night, Because we've won a gallant fightAnd conquered all our foes.

642,3,642_3.jpg,"""Because you are much too tender-hearted, Your Majesty.""""It may be—it may be,"" agreed Rinkitink, sadly. ""It is one of my greatest failings. But what chance brought you here, my Lord Pinkerbloo?""""We have searched for you everywhere, sire, and all the people of Gilgad have been in despair since you so mysteriously disappeared. We could not appoint a new King, because we did not know but that you still lived; so we set out to find you, dead or alive. After visiting many islands of the Nonestic Ocean we at last thought of Pingaree, from where come the precious pearls; and now our faithful quest has been rewarded.""""And what now?"" asked Rinkitink.""Now, Your Majesty, you must come home with us, like a good and dutiful King, and rule over your people,"" declared the man in a firm voice.""But you must—begging Your Majesty's pardon for the contradiction.""""Kitticut,"" cried poor Rinkitink, ""you must save me from being captured by these, my subjects. What! must I return to Gilgad and be forced to reign in splendid state when I much prefer to eat and sleep and sing in my own quiet way? They will make me sit in a throne three hours a day and listen to dry and tedious affairs of state; and I must stand up for hours at the court receptions, till I get corns on my heels; and forever must I listen to tiresome speeches and endless petitions and complaints!""""But someone must do this, Your Majesty,"" said Pinkerbloo respectfully, ""and since you were born to be our King you cannot escape your duty.""""'Tis a horrid fate!"" moaned Rinkitink. ""I would die willingly, rather than be a King—if it did not hurt so terribly to die.""""You will find it much more comfortable to reign than to die, although I fully appreciate Your Majesty's difficult position and am truly sorry for you,"" said Pinkerbloo.King Kitticut had listened to this conversation thoughtfully, so now he said to his friend:""The man is right, dear Rinkitink. It is your duty to reign, since fate has made you a King, and I see no honorable escape for you. I shall grieve to lose your companionship, but I feel the separation cannot be avoided.""""Then,"" said he, turning to Lord Pinkerbloo, ""in three days I will depart with you for Gilgad; but during those three days I propose to feast and make merry with my good friend King Kitticut.""Then all the people of Gilgad shouted with delight and eagerly scrambled ashore to take their part in the festival.Those three days were long remembered in Pingaree, for never—before nor since—has such feasting and jollity been known upon that island. Rinkitink made the most of his time and everyone laughed and sang with him by day and by night.Then, at last, the hour of parting arrived and the King of Gilgad and Ruler of the Dominion of Rinkitink was escorted by a grand procession to his boat and seated upon his golden throne. The rowers of the fifty boats paused, with their glittering oars pointed into the air like gigantic uplifted sabres, while the people of Pingaree—men, women and children—stood upon the shore shouting a royal farewell to the jolly King.",25581_11.jpg

659,1,659_1.jpg,       I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS     ,421_1.jpg
659,2,659_2.jpg,"       “Nay,” said Mr. Campbell, “who can tell that for a surety? But the name of       that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear—Balfours of Shaws: an       ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter days       decayed. Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his position;       no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner or the       speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember) I took aye       a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and those of my       own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire, Campbell of Minch,       and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure in his society.       Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before you, here is the       testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own hand of our departed       brother.”             He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: “To the hands       of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these will       be delivered by my son, David Balfour.” My heart was beating hard at this       great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen years of       age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of Ettrick.            “Mr. Campbell,” I stammered, “and if you were in my shoes, would you go?”             “Of a surety,” said the minister, “that would I, and without pause. A       pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by Edinburgh)       in two days of walk. If the worst came to the worst, and your high       relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your blood)       should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back again and       risp at the manse door. But I would rather hope that ye shall be well       received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything that I       ken come to be a great man in time. And here, Davie, laddie,” he resumed,       “it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and set you on       the right guard against the dangers of the world.”             Here he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder under       a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long, serious       upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks, put his       pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him. There, then, with       uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a considerable       number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged upon me to be       instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible. That done, he drew a       picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I should conduct       myself with its inhabitants.            “Be soople, Davie, in things immaterial,” said he. “Bear ye this in mind,       that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing. Dinnae shame us,       Davie, dinnae shame us! In yon great, muckle house, with all these       domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect, as       quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any. As for the laird—remember       he’s the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour. It’s a pleasure to       obey a laird; or should be, to the young.”             “Well, sir,” said I, “it may be; and I’ll promise you I’ll try to make it       so.”             “Why, very well said,” replied Mr. Campbell, heartily. “And now to come to       the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here a       little packet which contains four things.” He tugged it, as he spoke, and       with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat. “Of these       four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money for your       father’s books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have explained       from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to the incoming       dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and myself would       be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round, will likely       please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie, it’s but a drop       of water in the sea; it’ll help you but a step, and vanish like the       morning. The second, which is flat and square and written upon, will stand       by you through life, like a good staff for the road, and a good pillow to       your head in sickness. And as for the last, which is cubical, that’ll see       you, it’s my prayerful wish, into a better land.”      ",421_2.jpg

660,0,660_0.jpg,"       “Hoot, hoot, hoot,” said the barber, “nae kind of a man, nae kind of a man       at all;” and began to ask me very shrewdly what my business was; but I was       more than a match for him at that, and he went on to his next customer no       wiser than he came.            I cannot well describe the blow this dealt to my illusions. The more       indistinct the accusations were, the less I liked them, for they left the       wider field to fancy. What kind of a great house was this, that all the       parish should start and stare to be asked the way to it? or what sort of a       gentleman, that his ill-fame should be thus current on the wayside? If an       hour’s walking would have brought me back to Essendean, I had left my       adventure then and there, and returned to Mr. Campbell’s. But when I had       come so far a way already, mere shame would not suffer me to desist till I       had put the matter to the touch of proof; I was bound, out of mere       self-respect, to carry it through; and little as I liked the sound of what       I heard, and slow as I began to travel, I still kept asking my way and       still kept advancing.            It was drawing on to sundown when I met a stout, dark, sour-looking woman       coming trudging down a hill; and she, when I had put my usual question,       turned sharp about, accompanied me back to the summit she had just left,       and pointed to a great bulk of building standing very bare upon a green in       the bottom of the next valley. The country was pleasant round about,       running in low hills, pleasantly watered and wooded, and the crops, to my       eyes, wonderfully good; but the house itself appeared to be a kind of       ruin; no road led up to it; no smoke arose from any of the chimneys; nor       was there any semblance of a garden. My heart sank. “That!” I cried.            The woman’s face lit up with a malignant anger. “That is the house of       Shaws!” she cried. “Blood built it; blood stopped the building of it;       blood shall bring it down. See here!” she cried again—“I spit upon       the ground, and crack my thumb at it! Black be its fall! If ye see the       laird, tell him what ye hear; tell him this makes the twelve hunner and       nineteen time that Jennet Clouston has called down the curse on him and       his house, byre and stable, man, guest, and master, wife, miss, or bairn—black,       black be their fall!”             And the woman, whose voice had risen to a kind of eldritch sing-song,       turned with a skip, and was gone. I stood where she left me, with my hair       on end. In those days folk still believed in witches and trembled at a       curse; and this one, falling so pat, like a wayside omen, to arrest me ere       I carried out my purpose, took the pith out of my legs.            I sat me down and stared at the house of Shaws. The more I looked, the       pleasanter that country-side appeared; being all set with hawthorn bushes       full of flowers; the fields dotted with sheep; a fine flight of rooks in       the sky; and every sign of a kind soil and climate; and yet the barrack in       the midst of it went sore against my fancy.            Country folk went by from the fields as I sat there on the side of the       ditch, but I lacked the spirit to give them a good-e’en. At last the sun       went down, and then, right up against the yellow sky, I saw a scroll of       smoke go mounting, not much thicker, as it seemed to me, than the smoke of       a candle; but still there it was, and meant a fire, and warmth, and       cookery, and some living inhabitant that must have lit it; and this       comforted my heart.            So I set forward by a little faint track in the grass that led in my       direction. It was very faint indeed to be the only way to a place of       habitation; yet I saw no other. Presently it brought me to stone uprights,       with an unroofed lodge beside them, and coats of arms upon the top. A main       entrance it was plainly meant to be, but never finished; instead of gates       of wrought iron, a pair of hurdles were tied across with a straw rope; and       as there were no park walls, nor any sign of avenue, the track that I was       following passed on the right hand of the pillars, and went wandering on       toward the house.

660,2,660_2.jpg,"       I said I feared it was his own supper.            “O,” said he, “I can do fine wanting it. I’ll take the ale, though, for it       slockens (moistens) my cough.” He drank the cup about half out, still       keeping an eye upon me as he drank; and then suddenly held out his hand.       “Let’s see the letter,” said he.            I told him the letter was for Mr. Balfour; not for him.            “And who do ye think I am?” says he. “Give me Alexander’s letter.”             “You know my father’s name?”             “It would be strange if I didnae,” he returned, “for he was my born       brother; and little as ye seem to like either me or my house, or my good       parritch, I’m your born uncle, Davie, my man, and you my born nephew. So       give us the letter, and sit down and fill your kyte.”             If I had been some years younger, what with shame, weariness, and       disappointment, I believe I had burst into tears. As it was, I could find       no words, neither black nor white, but handed him the letter, and sat down       to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a young man had.            Meanwhile, my uncle, stooping over the fire, turned the letter over and       over in his hands.     ",421_6.jpg

661,0,661_0.jpg,"       “Na,” said he, very cunningly. “Nae lights in my house.”             “Very well, sir,” said I. “Are the stairs good?”             “They’re grand,” said he; and then, as I was going, “Keep to the wall,” he       added; “there’s nae bannisters. But the stairs are grand underfoot.”             Out I went into the night. The wind was still moaning in the distance,       though never a breath of it came near the house of Shaws. It had fallen       blacker than ever; and I was glad to feel along the wall, till I came the       length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing. I had       got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it, when all upon a       sudden, without sound of wind or thunder, the whole sky lighted up with       wild fire and went black again. I had to put my hand over my eyes to get       back to the colour of the darkness; and indeed I was already half blinded       when I stepped into the tower.            It was so dark inside, it seemed a body could scarce breathe; but I pushed       out with foot and hand, and presently struck the wall with the one, and       the lowermost round of the stair with the other. The wall, by the touch,       was of fine hewn stone; the steps too, though somewhat steep and narrow,       were of polished masonwork, and regular and solid underfoot. Minding my       uncle’s word about the bannisters, I kept close to the tower side, and       felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart.            The house of Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not counting lofts.       Well, as I advanced, it seemed to me the stair grew airier and a thought       more lightsome; and I was wondering what might be the cause of this       change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went. If I       did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I did       not fall, it was more by Heaven’s mercy than my own strength. It was not       only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the wall,       so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but the       same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length, and       that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the well.            This was the grand stair! I thought; and with the thought, a gust of a       kind of angry courage came into my heart. My uncle had sent me here,       certainly to run great risks, perhaps to die. I swore I would settle that       “perhaps,” if I should break my neck for it; got me down upon my hands and       knees; and as slowly as a snail, feeling before me every inch, and testing       the solidity of every stone, I continued to ascend the stair. The       darkness, by contrast with the flash, appeared to have redoubled; nor was       that all, for my ears were now troubled and my mind confounded by a great       stir of bats in the top part of the tower, and the foul beasts, flying       downwards, sometimes beat about my face and body.            The tower, I should have said, was square; and in every corner the step       was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights. Well,       I had come close to one of these turns, when, feeling forward as usual, my       hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness beyond it. The       stair had been carried no higher; to set a stranger mounting it in the       darkness was to send him straight to his death; and (although, thanks to       the lightning and my own precautions, I was safe enough) the mere thought       of the peril in which I might have stood, and the dreadful height I might       have fallen from, brought out the sweat upon my body and relaxed my       joints.     ",421_8.jpg
661,1,661_1.jpg,       I GO TO THE QUEEN’S FERRY     ,421_9.jpg
661,2,661_2.jpg,"       uch rain fell in the night; and the next morning there blew a bitter       wintry wind out of the north-west, driving scattered clouds. For all that,       and before the sun began to peep or the last of the stars had vanished, I       made my way to the side of the burn, and had a plunge in a deep whirling       pool. All aglow from my bath, I sat down once more beside the fire, which       I replenished, and began gravely to consider my position.            There was now no doubt about my uncle’s enmity; there was no doubt I       carried my life in my hand, and he would leave no stone unturned that he       might compass my destruction. But I was young and spirited, and like most       lads that have been country-bred, I had a great opinion of my shrewdness.       I had come to his door no better than a beggar and little more than a       child; he had met me with treachery and violence; it would be a fine       consummation to take the upper hand, and drive him like a herd of sheep.            I sat there nursing my knee and smiling at the fire; and I saw myself in       fancy smell out his secrets one after another, and grow to be that man’s       king and ruler. The warlock of Essendean, they say, had made a mirror in       which men could read the future; it must have been of other stuff than       burning coal; for in all the shapes and pictures that I sat and gazed at,       there was never a ship, never a seaman with a hairy cap, never a big       bludgeon for my silly head, or the least sign of all those tribulations       that were ripe to fall on me.            Presently, all swollen with conceit, I went up-stairs and gave my prisoner       his liberty. He gave me good-morning civilly; and I gave the same to him,       smiling down upon him, from the heights of my sufficiency. Soon we were       set to breakfast, as it might have been the day before.            “Well, sir,” said I, with a jeering tone, “have you nothing more to say to       me?” And then, as he made no articulate reply, “It will be time, I think,       to understand each other,” I continued. “You took me for a country Johnnie       Raw, with no more mother-wit or courage than a porridge-stick. I took you       for a good man, or no worse than others at the least. It seems we were       both wrong. What cause you have to fear me, to cheat me, and to attempt my       life—”             He murmured something about a jest, and that he liked a bit of fun; and       then, seeing me smile, changed his tone, and assured me he would make all       clear as soon as we had breakfasted. I saw by his face that he had no lie       ready for me, though he was hard at work preparing one; and I think I was       about to tell him so, when we were interrupted by a knocking at the door.            Bidding my uncle sit where he was, I went to open it, and found on the       doorstep a half-grown boy in sea-clothes. He had no sooner seen me than he       began to dance some steps of the sea-hornpipe (which I had never before       heard of far less seen), snapping his fingers in the air and footing it       right cleverly. For all that, he was blue with the cold; and there was       something in his face, a look between tears and laughter, that was highly       pathetic and consisted ill with this gaiety of manner.

662,0,662_0.jpg,"       “Sir,” said he, “Mr. Balfour tells me great things of you; and for my own       part, I like your looks. I wish I was for longer here, that we might make       the better friends; but we’ll make the most of what we have. Ye shall come       on board my brig for half an hour, till the ebb sets, and drink a bowl       with me.”             Now, I longed to see the inside of a ship more than words can tell; but I       was not going to put myself in jeopardy, and I told him my uncle and I had       an appointment with a lawyer.            “Ay, ay,” said he, “he passed me word of that. But, ye see, the boat’ll       set ye ashore at the town pier, and that’s but a penny stonecast from       Rankeillor’s house.” And here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in my       ear: “Take care of the old tod;* he means mischief. Come aboard till I can       get a word with ye.” And then, passing his arm through mine, he continued       aloud, as he set off towards his boat: “But, come, what can I bring ye       from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour’s can command. A roll of       tobacco? Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone pipe? the       mocking-bird that mews for all the world like a cat? the cardinal bird       that is as red as blood?—take your pick and say your pleasure.”             By this time we were at the boat-side, and he was handing me in. I did not       dream of hanging back; I thought (the poor fool!) that I had found a good       friend and helper, and I was rejoiced to see the ship. As soon as we were       all set in our places, the boat was thrust off from the pier and began to       move over the waters: and what with my pleasure in this new movement and       my surprise at our low position, and the appearance of the shores, and the       growing bigness of the brig as we drew near to it, I could hardly       understand what the captain said, and must have answered him at random.            As soon as we were alongside (where I sat fairly gaping at the ship’s       height, the strong humming of the tide against its sides, and the pleasant       cries of the seamen at their work) Hoseason, declaring that he and I must       be the first aboard, ordered a tackle to be sent down from the main-yard.       In this I was whipped into the air and set down again on the deck, where       the captain stood ready waiting for me, and instantly slipped back his arm       under mine. There I stood some while, a little dizzy with the unsteadiness       of all around me, perhaps a little afraid, and yet vastly pleased with       these strange sights; the captain meanwhile pointing out the strangest,       and telling me their names and uses.            “But where is my uncle?” said I suddenly.            “Ay,” said Hoseason, with a sudden grimness, “that’s the point.”             I felt I was lost. With all my strength, I plucked myself clear of him and       ran to the bulwarks. Sure enough, there was the boat pulling for the town,       with my uncle sitting in the stern. I gave a piercing cry—“Help,       help! Murder!”—so that both sides of the anchorage rang with it, and       my uncle turned round where he was sitting, and showed me a face full of       cruelty and terror.     ",421_12.jpg
662,1,662_1.jpg,       I GO TO SEA IN THE BRIG “COVENANT” OF DYSART     ,421_13.jpg
662,2,662_2.jpg,"       came to myself in darkness, in great pain, bound hand and foot, and       deafened by many unfamiliar noises. There sounded in my ears a roaring of       water as of a huge mill-dam, the thrashing of heavy sprays, the thundering       of the sails, and the shrill cries of seamen. The whole world now heaved       giddily up, and now rushed giddily downward; and so sick and hurt was I in       body, and my mind so much confounded, that it took me a long while,       chasing my thoughts up and down, and ever stunned again by a fresh stab of       pain, to realise that I must be lying somewhere bound in the belly of that       unlucky ship, and that the wind must have strengthened to a gale. With the       clear perception of my plight, there fell upon me a blackness of despair,       a horror of remorse at my own folly, and a passion of anger at my uncle,       that once more bereft me of my senses.            When I returned again to life, the same uproar, the same confused and       violent movements, shook and deafened me; and presently, to my other pains       and distresses, there was added the sickness of an unused landsman on the       sea. In that time of my adventurous youth, I suffered many hardships; but       none that was so crushing to my mind and body, or lit by so few hopes, as       these first hours aboard the brig.            I heard a gun fire, and supposed the storm had proved too strong for us,       and we were firing signals of distress. The thought of deliverance, even       by death in the deep sea, was welcome to me. Yet it was no such matter;       but (as I was afterwards told) a common habit of the captain’s, which I       here set down to show that even the worst man may have his kindlier side.       We were then passing, it appeared, within some miles of Dysart, where the       brig was built, and where old Mrs. Hoseason, the captain’s mother, had       come some years before to live; and whether outward or inward bound, the       Covenant was never suffered to go by that place by day, without a gun       fired and colours shown.            I had no measure of time; day and night were alike in that ill-smelling       cavern of the ship’s bowels where I lay; and the misery of my situation       drew out the hours to double. How long, therefore, I lay waiting to hear       the ship split upon some rock, or to feel her reel head foremost into the       depths of the sea, I have not the means of computation. But sleep at       length stole from me the consciousness of sorrow.            I was awakened by the light of a hand-lantern shining in my face. A small       man of about thirty, with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair, stood       looking down at me.     ",421_14.jpg
662,3,662_3.jpg,"       The brig was sheering swiftly and giddily through a long, cresting swell.       She was on the starboard tack, and on the left hand, under the arched foot       of the foresail, I could see the sunset still quite bright. This, at such       an hour of the night, surprised me greatly; but I was too ignorant to draw       the true conclusion—that we were going north-about round Scotland,       and were now on the high sea between the Orkney and Shetland Islands,       having avoided the dangerous currents of the Pentland Firth. For my part,       who had been so long shut in the dark and knew nothing of head-winds, I       thought we might be half-way or more across the Atlantic. And indeed       (beyond that I wondered a little at the lateness of the sunset light) I       gave no heed to it, and pushed on across the decks, running between the       seas, catching at ropes, and only saved from going overboard by one of the       hands on deck, who had been always kind to me.            The round-house, for which I was bound, and where I was now to sleep and       serve, stood some six feet above the decks, and considering the size of       the brig, was of good dimensions. Inside were a fixed table and bench, and       two berths, one for the captain and the other for the two mates, turn and       turn about. It was all fitted with lockers from top to bottom, so as to       stow away the officers’ belongings and a part of the ship’s stores; there       was a second store-room underneath, which you entered by a hatchway in the       middle of the deck; indeed, all the best of the meat and drink and the       whole of the powder were collected in this place; and all the firearms,       except the two pieces of brass ordnance, were set in a rack in the       aftermost wall of the round-house. The most of the cutlasses were in       another place.            A small window with a shutter on each side, and a skylight in the roof,       gave it light by day; and after dark there was a lamp always burning. It       was burning when I entered, not brightly, but enough to show Mr. Shuan       sitting at the table, with the brandy bottle and a tin pannikin in front       of him. He was a tall man, strongly made and very black; and he stared       before him on the table like one stupid.            He took no notice of my coming in; nor did he move when the captain       followed and leant on the berth beside me, looking darkly at the mate. I       stood in great fear of Hoseason, and had my reasons for it; but something       told me I need not be afraid of him just then; and I whispered in his ear:       “How is he?” He shook his head like one that does not know and does not       wish to think, and his face was very stern.            Presently Mr. Riach came in. He gave the captain a glance that meant the       boy was dead as plain as speaking, and took his place like the rest of us;       so that we all three stood without a word, staring down at Mr. Shuan, and       Mr. Shuan (on his side) sat without a word, looking hard upon the table.            All of a sudden he put out his hand to take the bottle; and at that Mr.       Riach started forward and caught it away from him, rather by surprise than       violence, crying out, with an oath, that there had been too much of this       work altogether, and that a judgment would fall upon the ship. And as he       spoke (the weather sliding-doors standing open) he tossed the bottle into       the sea.            Mr. Shuan was on his feet in a trice; he still looked dazed, but he meant       murder, ay, and would have done it, for the second time that night, had       not the captain stepped in between him and his victim.            “Sit down!” roars the captain. “Ye sot and swine, do ye know what ye’ve       done? Ye’ve murdered the boy!”      ",421_15.jpg

Some days she       made a little way; others, she was driven actually back. At last we were       beaten so far to the south that we tossed and tacked to and fro the whole       of the ninth day, within sight of Cape Wrath and the wild, rocky coast on       either hand of it. There followed on that a council of the officers, and       some decision which I did not rightly understand, seeing only the result:       that we had made a fair wind of a foul one and were running south.            The tenth afternoon there was a falling swell and a thick, wet, white fog       that hid one end of the brig from the other. All afternoon, when I went on       deck, I saw men and officers listening hard over the bulwarks—“for       breakers,” they said; and though I did not so much as understand the word,       I felt danger in the air, and was excited.            Maybe about ten at night, I was serving Mr. Riach and the captain at their       supper, when the ship struck something with a great sound, and we heard       voices singing out. My two masters leaped to their feet.            “She’s struck!” said Mr. Riach.            “No, sir,” said the captain. “We’ve only run a boat down.”             And they hurried out.     ",421_17.jpg

663,3,663_3.jpg,"       After that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before. Only       now, one person spoke most of the time, as though laying down a plan, and       first one and then another answered him briefly, like men taking orders.       By this, I made sure they were coming on again, and told Alan.            “It’s what we have to pray for,” said he. “Unless we can give them a good       distaste of us, and done with it, there’ll be nae sleep for either you or       me. But this time, mind, they’ll be in earnest.”             By this, my pistols were ready, and there was nothing to do but listen and       wait. While the brush lasted, I had not the time to think if I was       frighted; but now, when all was still again, my mind ran upon nothing       else. The thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in me;       and presently, when I began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing of men’s       clothes against the round-house wall, and knew they were taking their       places in the dark, I could have found it in my mind to cry out aloud.            All this was upon Alan’s side; and I had begun to think my share of the       fight was at an end, when I heard some one drop softly on the roof above       me.            Then there came a single call on the sea-pipe, and that was the signal. A       knot of them made one rush of it, cutlass in hand, against the door; and       at the same moment, the glass of the skylight was dashed in a thousand       pieces, and a man leaped through and landed on the floor. Before he got       his feet, I had clapped a pistol to his back, and might have shot him,       too; only at the touch of him (and him alive) my whole flesh misgave me,       and I could no more pull the trigger than I could have flown.            He had dropped his cutlass as he jumped, and when he felt the pistol,       whipped straight round and laid hold of me, roaring out an oath; and at       that either my courage came again, or I grew so much afraid as came to the       same thing; for I gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the body. He       gave the most horrible, ugly groan and fell to the floor. The foot of a       second fellow, whose legs were dangling through the skylight, struck me at       the same time upon the head; and at that I snatched another pistol and       shot this one through the thigh, so that he slipped through and tumbled in       a lump on his companion’s body. There was no talk of missing, any more       than there was time to aim; I clapped the muzzle to the very place and       fired.            I might have stood and stared at them for long, but I heard Alan shout as       if for help, and that brought me to my senses.            He had kept the door so long; but one of the seamen, while he was engaged       with others, had run in under his guard and caught him about the body.       Alan was dirking him with his left hand, but the fellow clung like a       leech. Another had broken in and had his cutlass raised. The door was       thronged with their faces. I thought we were lost, and catching up my       cutlass, fell on them in flank.     ",421_19.jpg

664,1,664_1.jpg,"       lan and I sat down to breakfast about six of the clock. The floor was       covered with broken glass and in a horrid mess of blood, which took away       my hunger. In all other ways we were in a situation not only agreeable but       merry; having ousted the officers from their own cabin, and having at       command all the drink in the ship—both wine and spirits—and       all the dainty part of what was eatable, such as the pickles and the fine       sort of bread. This, of itself, was enough to set us in good humour, but       the richest part of it was this, that the two thirstiest men that ever       came out of Scotland (Mr. Shuan being dead) were now shut in the fore-part       of the ship and condemned to what they hated most—cold water.            “And depend upon it,” Alan said, “we shall hear more of them ere long. Ye       may keep a man from the fighting, but never from his bottle.”             We made good company for each other. Alan, indeed, expressed himself most       lovingly; and taking a knife from the table, cut me off one of the silver       buttons from his coat.     ",421_21.jpg
664,2,664_2.jpg,       I HEAR OF THE “RED FOX”      ,421_22.jpg
664,3,664_3.jpg,"       efore we had done cleaning out the round-house, a breeze sprang up from a       little to the east of north. This blew off the rain and brought out the       sun.            And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map. On       the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan’s boat, we had been running       through the Little Minch. At dawn after the battle, we lay becalmed to the       east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle Eriska in the chain of       the Long Island. Now to get from there to the Linnhe Loch, the straight       course was through the narrows of the Sound of Mull. But the captain had       no chart; he was afraid to trust his brig so deep among the islands; and       the wind serving well, he preferred to go by west of Tiree and come up       under the southern coast of the great Isle of Mull.            All day the breeze held in the same point, and rather freshened than died       down; and towards afternoon, a swell began to set in from round the outer       Hebrides. Our course, to go round about the inner isles, was to the west       of south, so that at first we had this swell upon our beam, and were much       rolled about. But after nightfall, when we had turned the end of Tiree and       began to head more to the east, the sea came right astern.     ",421_23.jpg
665,0,665_0.jpg,"       All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other thing:       that I asked Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it was; and       he answered, it was the worst possible for him, for it was a land of the       Campbells.            We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and       cry us warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when       this man sang out pretty shrill: “For God’s sake, hold on!” We knew by his       tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough, there       followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted her       over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too weak,       I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean over       the bulwarks into the sea.            I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the       moon, and then down again. They say a man sinks a third time for good. I       cannot be made like other folk, then; for I would not like to write how       often I went down, or how often I came up again. All the while, I was       being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed whole;       and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither sorry nor       afraid.            Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat. And       then all of a sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to myself.            It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far I       had travelled from the brig. I hailed her, indeed; but it was plain she       was already out of cry. She was still holding together; but whether or not       they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too low down to see.            While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between us       where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and       bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles. Sometimes the whole tract       swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; sometimes, for a       glimpse, it would all disappear and then boil up again. What it was I had       no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know it       must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so fast       and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that play,       had flung out me and the spare yard upon its landward margin.            I now lay quite becalmed, and began to feel that a man can die of cold as       well as of drowning. The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see in       the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in the       rocks.            “Well,” thought I to myself, “if I cannot get as far as that, it’s       strange!”      ",421_24.jpg
665,1,665_1.jpg,"       Charles the Second declared a man could stay outdoors more days in the       year in the climate of England than in any other. This was very like a       king, with a palace at his back and changes of dry clothes. But he must       have had better luck on his flight from Worcester than I had on that       miserable isle. It was the height of the summer; yet it rained for more       than twenty-four hours, and did not clear until the afternoon of the third       day.            This was the day of incidents. In the morning I saw a red deer, a buck       with a fine spread of antlers, standing in the rain on the top of the       island; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock, before he       trotted off upon the other side. I supposed he must have swum the strait;       though what should bring any creature to Earraid, was more than I could       fancy.            A little after, as I was jumping about after my limpets, I was startled by       a guinea-piece, which fell upon a rock in front of me and glanced off into       the sea. When the sailors gave me my money again, they kept back not only       about a third of the whole sum, but my father’s leather purse; so that       from that day out, I carried my gold loose in a pocket with a button. I       now saw there must be a hole, and clapped my hand to the place in a great       hurry. But this was to lock the stable door after the steed was stolen. I       had left the shore at Queensferry with near on fifty pounds; now I found       no more than two guinea-pieces and a silver shilling.            It is true I picked up a third guinea a little after, where it lay shining       on a piece of turf. That made a fortune of three pounds and four       shillings, English money, for a lad, the rightful heir of an estate, and       now starving on an isle at the extreme end of the wild Highlands.            This state of my affairs dashed me still further; and, indeed my plight on       that third morning was truly pitiful. My clothes were beginning to rot; my       stockings in particular were quite worn through, so that my shanks went       naked; my hands had grown quite soft with the continual soaking; my throat       was very sore, my strength had much abated, and my heart so turned against       the horrid stuff I was condemned to eat, that the very sight of it came       near to sicken me.            And yet the worst was not yet come.            There is a pretty high rock on the northwest of Earraid, which (because it       had a flat top and overlooked the Sound) I was much in the habit of       frequenting; not that ever I stayed in one place, save when asleep, my       misery giving me no rest. Indeed, I wore myself down with continual and       aimless goings and comings in the rain.            As soon, however, as the sun came out, I lay down on the top of that rock       to dry myself. The comfort of the sunshine is a thing I cannot tell. It       set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of which I had begun to       despair; and I scanned the sea and the Ross with a fresh interest. On the       south of my rock, a part of the island jutted out and hid the open ocean,       so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon that side, and I be none       the wiser.

665,3,665_3.jpg,"       “Was it too much?” I asked, a little faltering.            “Too much!” cries he. “Why, I will guide you to Torosay myself for a dram       of brandy. And give you the great pleasure of my company (me that is a man       of some learning) in the bargain.”             I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide; but at that he       laughed aloud, and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle.            “In the Isle of Mull, at least,” says he, “where I know every stone and       heather-bush by mark of head. See, now,” he said, striking right and left,       as if to make sure, “down there a burn is running; and at the head of it       there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of       that; and it’s hard at the foot of the hill, that the way runs by to       Torosay; and the way here, being for droves, is plainly trodden, and will       show grassy through the heather.”             I had to own he was right in every feature, and told my wonder.            “Ha!” says he, “that’s nothing. Would ye believe me now, that before the       Act came out, and when there were weepons in this country, I could shoot?       Ay, could I!” cries he, and then with a leer: “If ye had such a thing as a       pistol here to try with, I would show ye how it’s done.”             I told him I had nothing of the sort, and gave him a wider berth. If he       had known, his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket,       and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt. But by the       better luck for me, he knew nothing, thought all was covered, and lied on       in the dark.            He then began to question me cunningly, where I came from, whether I was       rich, whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him (which he       declared he had that moment in his sporran), and all the time he kept       edging up to me and I avoiding him. We were now upon a sort of green       cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay, and we kept changing       sides upon that like dancers in a reel. I had so plainly the upper-hand       that my spirits rose, and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of       blindman’s buff; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier, and at last       began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff.

666,1,666_1.jpg,"       “He is to turn the tenants out by force, I hear?” said I.            “Yes,” says he, “but the business has gone back and forth, as folk say.       First, James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh, and got some lawyer (a       Stewart, nae doubt—they all hing together like bats in a steeple)       and had the proceedings stayed. And then Colin Campbell cam’ in again, and       had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer. And now they tell me       the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow. It’s to begin at Duror       under James’s very windows, which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of       it.”             “Do you think they’ll fight?” I asked.            “Well,” says Henderland, “they’re disarmed—or supposed to be—for       there’s still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places. And then       Colin Campbell has the sogers coming. But for all that, if I was his lady       wife, I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again. They’re queer       customers, the Appin Stewarts.”             I asked if they were worse than their neighbours.            “No they,” said he. “And that’s the worst part of it. For if Colin Roy can       get his business done in Appin, he has it all to begin again in the next       country, which they call Mamore, and which is one of the countries of the       Camerons. He’s King’s Factor upon both, and from both he has to drive out       the tenants; and indeed, Mr. Balfour (to be open with ye), it’s my belief       that if he escapes the one lot, he’ll get his death by the other.”             So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day; until at       last, Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company, and       satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell’s (“whom,” says he,       “I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion”),       proposed that I should make a short stage, and lie the night in his house       a little beyond Kingairloch. To say truth, I was overjoyed; for I had no       great desire for John of the Claymore, and since my double misadventure,       first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper, I stood in some       fear of any Highland stranger. Accordingly we shook hands upon the       bargain, and came in the afternoon to a small house, standing alone by the       shore of the Linnhe Loch. The sun was already gone from the desert       mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side, but shone on those of Appin on       the farther; the loch lay as still as a lake, only the gulls were crying       round the sides of it; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth.            We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland’s dwelling, than to my       great surprise (for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders) he       burst rudely past me, dashed into the room, caught up a jar and a small       horn-spoon, and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive       quantities. Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing, and looked round upon me       with a rather silly smile.     ",421_29.jpg

666,3,666_3.jpg,"       All this time I had been running on my side, and had got a good way up,       when a voice cried upon me to stand.            I was at the edge of the upper wood, and so now, when I halted and looked       back, I saw all the open part of the hill below me.            The lawyer and the sheriff’s officer were standing just above the road,       crying and waving on me to come back; and on their left, the red-coats,       musket in hand, were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood.            “Why should I come back?” I cried. “Come you on!”             “Ten pounds if ye take that lad!” cried the lawyer. “He’s an accomplice.       He was posted here to hold us in talk.”             At that word (which I could hear quite plainly, though it was to the       soldiers and not to me that he was crying it) my heart came in my mouth       with quite a new kind of terror. Indeed, it is one thing to stand the       danger of your life, and quite another to run the peril of both life and       character. The thing, besides, had come so suddenly, like thunder out of a       clear sky, that I was all amazed and helpless.            The soldiers began to spread, some of them to run, and others to put up       their pieces and cover me; and still I stood.            “Jouk* in here among the trees,” said a voice close by.

667,1,667_1.jpg,"       This frightened me a little, I confess, and would have frightened me more       if I had known how nearly exact were Alan’s predictions; indeed it was but       in one point that he exaggerated, there being but eleven Campbells on the       jury; though as the other four were equally in the Duke’s dependence, it       mattered less than might appear. Still, I cried out that he was unjust to       the Duke of Argyle, who (for all he was a Whig) was yet a wise and honest       nobleman.            “Hoot!” said Alan, “the man’s a Whig, nae doubt; but I would never deny he       was a good chieftain to his clan. And what would the clan think if there       was a Campbell shot, and naebody hanged, and their own chief the Justice       General? But I have often observed,” says Alan, “that you Low-country       bodies have no clear idea of what’s right and wrong.”             At this I did at last laugh out aloud, when to my surprise, Alan joined       in, and laughed as merrily as myself.            “Na, na,” said he, “we’re in the Hielands, David; and when I tell ye to       run, take my word and run. Nae doubt it’s a hard thing to skulk and starve       in the Heather, but it’s harder yet to lie shackled in a red-coat prison.”             I asked him whither we should flee; and as he told me “to the Lowlands,” I       was a little better inclined to go with him; for, indeed, I was growing       impatient to get back and have the upper-hand of my uncle. Besides, Alan       made so sure there would be no question of justice in the matter, that I       began to be afraid he might be right. Of all deaths, I would truly like       least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that uncanny instrument       came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I had once seen it       engraved at the top of a pedlar’s ballad) and took away my appetite for       courts of justice.            “I’ll chance it, Alan,” said I. “I’ll go with you.”             “But mind you,” said Alan, “it’s no small thing. Ye maun lie bare and       hard, and brook many an empty belly. Your bed shall be the moorcock’s, and       your life shall be like the hunted deer’s, and ye shall sleep with your       hand upon your weapons. Ay, man, ye shall taigle many a weary foot, or we       get clear! I tell ye this at the start, for it’s a life that I ken well.       But if ye ask what other chance ye have, I answer: Nane. Either take to       the heather with me, or else hang.”             “And that’s a choice very easily made,” said I; and we shook hands upon       it.     ",421_33.jpg

667,3,667_3.jpg,"       ight fell as we were walking, and the clouds, which had broken up in the       afternoon, settled in and thickened, so that it fell, for the season of       the year, extremely dark. The way we went was over rough mountainsides;       and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner, I could by no means see       how he directed himself.            At last, about half-past ten of the clock, we came to the top of a brae,       and saw lights below us. It seemed a house door stood open and let out a       beam of fire and candle-light; and all round the house and steading five       or six persons were moving hurriedly about, each carrying a lighted brand.            “James must have tint his wits,” said Alan. “If this was the soldiers       instead of you and me, he would be in a bonny mess. But I dare say he’ll       have a sentry on the road, and he would ken well enough no soldiers would       find the way that we came.”      ",421_35.jpg

668,1,668_1.jpg,"       ometimes we walked, sometimes ran; and as it drew on to morning, walked       ever the less and ran the more. Though, upon its face, that country       appeared to be a desert, yet there were huts and houses of the people, of       which we must have passed more than twenty, hidden in quiet places of the       hills. When we came to one of these, Alan would leave me in the way, and       go himself and rap upon the side of the house and speak awhile at the       window with some sleeper awakened. This was to pass the news; which, in       that country, was so much of a duty that Alan must pause to attend to it       even while fleeing for his life; and so well attended to by others, that       in more than half of the houses where we called they had heard already of       the murder. In the others, as well as I could make out (standing back at a       distance and hearing a strange tongue), the news was received with more of       consternation than surprise.            For all our hurry, day began to come in while we were still far from any       shelter. It found us in a prodigious valley, strewn with rocks and where       ran a foaming river. Wild mountains stood around it; there grew there       neither grass nor trees; and I have sometimes thought since then, that it       may have been the valley called Glencoe, where the massacre was in the       time of King William. But for the details of our itinerary, I am all to       seek; our way lying now by short cuts, now by great detours; our pace       being so hurried, our time of journeying usually by night; and the names       of such places as I asked and heard being in the Gaelic tongue and the       more easily forgotten.            The first peep of morning, then, showed us this horrible place, and I       could see Alan knit his brow.            “This is no fit place for you and me,” he said. “This is a place they’re       bound to watch.”             And with that he ran harder than ever down to the water-side, in a part       where the river was split in two among three rocks. It went through with a       horrid thundering that made my belly quake; and there hung over the lynn a       little mist of spray. Alan looked neither to the right nor to the left,       but jumped clean upon the middle rock and fell there on his hands and       knees to check himself, for that rock was small and he might have pitched       over on the far side. I had scarce time to measure the distance or to       understand the peril before I had followed him, and he had caught and       stopped me.            So there we stood, side by side upon a small rock slippery with spray, a       far broader leap in front of us, and the river dinning upon all sides.       When I saw where I was, there came on me a deadly sickness of fear, and I       put my hand over my eyes. Alan took me and shook me; I saw he was       speaking, but the roaring of the falls and the trouble of my mind       prevented me from hearing; only I saw his face was red with anger, and       that he stamped upon the rock. The same look showed me the water raging       by, and the mist hanging in the air: and with that I covered my eyes again       and shuddered.            The next minute Alan had set the brandy bottle to my lips, and forced me       to drink about a gill, which sent the blood into my head again. Then,       putting his hands to his mouth, and his mouth to my ear, he shouted, “Hang       or drown!” and turning his back upon me, leaped over the farther branch of       the stream, and landed safe.     ",421_37.jpg
668,2,668_2.jpg,"       The name of the cleft was the Heugh of Corrynakiegh; and although from its       height and being so near upon the sea, it was often beset with clouds, yet       it was on the whole a pleasant place, and the five days we lived in it       went happily.            We slept in the cave, making our bed of heather bushes which we cut for       that purpose, and covering ourselves with Alan’s great-coat. There was a       low concealed place, in a turning of the glen, where we were so bold as to       make fire: so that we could warm ourselves when the clouds set in, and       cook hot porridge, and grill the little trouts that we caught with our       hands under the stones and overhanging banks of the burn. This was indeed       our chief pleasure and business; and not only to save our meal against       worse times, but with a rivalry that much amused us, we spent a great part       of our days at the water-side, stripped to the waist and groping about or       (as they say) guddling for these fish. The largest we got might have been       a quarter of a pound; but they were of good flesh and flavour, and when       broiled upon the coals, lacked only a little salt to be delicious.            In any by-time Alan must teach me to use my sword, for my ignorance had       much distressed him; and I think besides, as I had sometimes the       upper-hand of him in the fishing, he was not sorry to turn to an exercise       where he had so much the upper-hand of me. He made it somewhat more of a       pain than need have been, for he stormed at me all through the lessons in       a very violent manner of scolding, and would push me so close that I made       sure he must run me through the body. I was often tempted to turn tail,       but held my ground for all that, and got some profit of my lessons; if it       was but to stand on guard with an assured countenance, which is often all       that is required. So, though I could never in the least please my master,       I was not altogether displeased with myself.            In the meanwhile, you are not to suppose that we neglected our chief       business, which was to get away.            “It will be many a long day,” Alan said to me on our first morning,       “before the red-coats think upon seeking Corrynakiegh; so now we must get       word sent to James, and he must find the siller for us.”             “And how shall we send that word?” says I. “We are here in a desert place,       which yet we dare not leave; and unless ye get the fowls of the air to be       your messengers, I see not what we shall be able to do.”             “Ay?” said Alan. “Ye’re a man of small contrivance, David.”             Thereupon he fell in a muse, looking in the embers of the fire; and       presently, getting a piece of wood, he fashioned it in a cross, the four       ends of which he blackened on the coals. Then he looked at me a little       shyly.     ",421_38.jpg
668,3,668_3.jpg,       THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER: THE MOOR     ,421_39.jpg
669,0,669_0.jpg,"       I looked to see if he were jesting; but no, the little man was in dead       earnest; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me.            “Lead away!” said I. “I’ll follow.”             He gave me one look as much as to say, “Well done, David!” and off he set       again at his top speed.            It grew cooler and even a little darker (but not much) with the coming of       the night. The sky was cloudless; it was still early in July, and pretty       far north; in the darkest part of that night, you would have needed pretty       good eyes to read, but for all that, I have often seen it darker in a       winter mid-day. Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like rain; and this       refreshed me for a while. When we stopped to breathe, and I had time to       see all about me, the clearness and sweetness of the night, the shapes of       the hills like things asleep, and the fire dwindling away behind us, like       a bright spot in the midst of the moor, anger would come upon me in a clap       that I must still drag myself in agony and eat the dust like a worm.            By what I have read in books, I think few that have held a pen were ever       really wearied, or they would write of it more strongly. I had no care of       my life, neither past nor future, and I scarce remembered there was such a       lad as David Balfour. I did not think of myself, but just of each fresh       step which I was sure would be my last, with despair—and of Alan,       who was the cause of it, with hatred. Alan was in the right trade as a       soldier; this is the officer’s part to make men continue to do things,       they know not wherefore, and when, if the choice was offered, they would       lie down where they were and be killed. And I dare say I would have made a       good enough private; for in these last hours it never occurred to me that       I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able, and die obeying.            Day began to come in, after years, I thought; and by that time we were       past the greatest danger, and could walk upon our feet like men, instead       of crawling like brutes. But, dear heart have mercy! what a pair we must       have made, going double like old grandfathers, stumbling like babes, and       as white as dead folk. Never a word passed between us; each set his mouth       and kept his eyes in front of him, and lifted up his foot and set it down       again, like people lifting weights at a country play;* all the while, with       the moorfowl crying “peep!” in the heather, and the light coming slowly       clearer in the east.            I say Alan did as I did. Not that ever I looked at him, for I had enough       ado to keep my feet; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid       with weariness as myself, and looked as little where we were going, or we       should not have walked into an ambush like blind men.            It fell in this way. We were going down a heathery brae, Alan leading and       I following a pace or two behind, like a fiddler and his wife; when upon a       sudden the heather gave a rustle, three or four ragged men leaped out, and       the next moment we were lying on our backs, each with a dirk at his       throat.     ",421_40.jpg
669,1,669_1.jpg,"       Quite at the top, and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above       the foliage, we found that strange house which was known in the country as       “Cluny’s Cage.” The trunks of several trees had been wattled across, the       intervals strengthened with stakes, and the ground behind this barricade       levelled up with earth to make the floor. A tree, which grew out from the       hillside, was the living centre-beam of the roof. The walls were of wattle       and covered with moss. The whole house had something of an egg shape; and       it half hung, half stood in that steep, hillside thicket, like a wasp’s       nest in a green hawthorn.            Within, it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some       comfort. A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the       fireplace; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock, and being       not dissimilar in colour, readily escaped notice from below.            This was but one of Cluny’s hiding-places; he had caves, besides, and       underground chambers in several parts of his country; and following the       reports of his scouts, he moved from one to another as the soldiers drew       near or moved away. By this manner of living, and thanks to the affection       of his clan, he had not only stayed all this time in safety, while so many       others had fled or been taken and slain: but stayed four or five years       longer, and only went to France at last by the express command of his       master. There he soon died; and it is strange to reflect that he may have       regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder.            When we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney, watching a       gillie about some cookery. He was mighty plainly habited, with a knitted       nightcap drawn over his ears, and smoked a foul cutty pipe. For all that       he had the manners of a king, and it was quite a sight to see him rise out       of his place to welcome us.            “Well, Mr. Stewart, come awa’, sir!” said he, “and bring in your friend       that as yet I dinna ken the name of.”             “And how is yourself, Cluny?” said Alan. “I hope ye do brawly, sir. And I       am proud to see ye, and to present to ye my friend the Laird of Shaws, Mr.       David Balfour.”             Alan never referred to my estate without a touch of a sneer, when we were       alone; but with strangers, he rang the words out like a herald.            “Step in by, the both of ye, gentlemen,” says Cluny. “I make ye welcome to       my house, which is a queer, rude place for certain, but one where I have       entertained a royal personage, Mr. Stewart—ye doubtless ken the       personage I have in my eye. We’ll take a dram for luck, and as soon as       this handless man of mine has the collops ready, we’ll dine and take a       hand at the cartes as gentlemen should. My life is a bit driegh,” says he,       pouring out the brandy; “I see little company, and sit and twirl my       thumbs, and mind upon a great day that is gone by, and weary for another       great day that we all hope will be upon the road. And so here’s a toast to       ye: The Restoration!”      ",421_41.jpg
669,2,669_2.jpg,"       “It’s the truth!” cried Alan, and he stood for a moment, wringing his       mouth in his hand like a man in sore perplexity. “It’s the bare truth,” he       said, and drew his sword. But before I could touch his blade with mine, he       had thrown it from him and fallen to the ground. “Na, na,” he kept saying,       “na, na—I cannae, I cannae.”             At this the last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself only       sick, and sorry, and blank, and wondering at myself. I would have given       the world to take back what I had said; but a word once spoken, who can       recapture it? I minded me of all Alan’s kindness and courage in the past,       how he had helped and cheered and borne with me in our evil days; and then       recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty       friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon me seemed to       redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness. I       thought I must have swooned where I stood.            This it was that gave me a thought. No apology could blot out what I had       said; it was needless to think of one, none could cover the offence; but       where an apology was vain, a mere cry for help might bring Alan back to my       side. I put my pride away from me. “Alan!” I said; “if ye cannae help me,       I must just die here.”             He started up sitting, and looked at me.            “It’s true,” said I. “I’m by with it. O, let me get into the bield of a       house—I’ll can die there easier.” I had no need to pretend; whether       I chose or not, I spoke in a weeping voice that would have melted a heart       of stone.            “Can ye walk?” asked Alan.            “No,” said I, “not without help. This last hour my legs have been fainting       under me; I’ve a stitch in my side like a red-hot iron; I cannae breathe       right. If I die, ye’ll can forgive me, Alan? In my heart, I liked ye fine—even       when I was the angriest.”             “Wheesht, wheesht!” cried Alan. “Dinna say that! David man, ye ken—”        He shut his mouth upon a sob. “Let me get my arm about ye,” he continued;       “that’s the way! Now lean upon me hard. Gude kens where there’s a house!       We’re in Balwhidder, too; there should be no want of houses, no, nor       friends’ houses here. Do ye gang easier so, Davie?”      ",421_42.jpg
669,3,669_3.jpg,"       “Me!” cried Alan, the blood starting to his face. “I give ye the lie.”             “Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes, then,” said Robin, “that ye seek       to change them for the sword?”             “And that’s very well said, Mr. Macgregor,” returned Alan; “and in the       meantime” (laying a strong accent on the word) “I take back the lie. I       appeal to Duncan.”             “Indeed, ye need appeal to naebody,” said Robin. “Ye’re a far better judge       than any Maclaren in Balquhidder: for it’s a God’s truth that you’re a       very creditable piper for a Stewart. Hand me the pipes.” Alan did as he       asked; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of Alan’s       variations, which it seemed that he remembered perfectly.            “Ay, ye have music,” said Alan, gloomily.            “And now be the judge yourself, Mr. Stewart,” said Robin; and taking up       the variations from the beginning, he worked them throughout to so new a       purpose, with such ingenuity and sentiment, and with so odd a fancy and so       quick a knack in the grace-notes, that I was amazed to hear him.            As for Alan, his face grew dark and hot, and he sat and gnawed his       fingers, like a man under some deep affront. “Enough!” he cried. “Ye can       blow the pipes—make the most of that.” And he made as if to rise.            But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck into       the slow measure of a pibroch. It was a fine piece of music in itself, and       nobly played; but it seems, besides, it was a piece peculiar to the Appin       Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan. The first notes were scarce out,       before there came a change in his face; when the time quickened, he seemed       to grow restless in his seat; and long before that piece was at an end,       the last signs of his anger died from him, and he had no thought but for       the music.     ",421_43.jpg
670,0,670_0.jpg,       END OF THE FLIGHT: WE PASS THE FORTH     ,421_44.jpg
670,1,670_1.jpg,"       “Well,” said I, “it’s to his door that I am bound, so you may judge by       that if I am an ill-doer; and I will tell you more, that though I am       indeed, by a dreadful error, in some peril of my life, King George has no       truer friend in all Scotland than myself.”             Her face cleared up mightily at this, although Alan’s darkened.            “That’s more than I would ask,” said she. “Mr. Rankeillor is a kennt man.”        And she bade us finish our meat, get clear of the clachan as soon as might       be, and lie close in the bit wood on the sea-beach. “And ye can trust me,”        says she, “I’ll find some means to put you over.”             At this we waited for no more, but shook hands with her upon the bargain,       made short work of the puddings, and set forth again from Limekilns as far       as to the wood. It was a small piece of perhaps a score of elders and       hawthorns and a few young ashes, not thick enough to veil us from       passersby upon the road or beach. Here we must lie, however, making the       best of the brave warm weather and the good hopes we now had of a       deliverance, and planing more particularly what remained for us to do.            We had but one trouble all day; when a strolling piper came and sat in the       same wood with us; a red-nosed, bleareyed, drunken dog, with a great       bottle of whisky in his pocket, and a long story of wrongs that had been       done him by all sorts of persons, from the Lord President of the Court of       Session, who had denied him justice, down to the Bailies of Inverkeithing       who had given him more of it than he desired. It was impossible but he       should conceive some suspicion of two men lying all day concealed in a       thicket and having no business to allege. As long as he stayed there he       kept us in hot water with prying questions; and after he was gone, as he       was a man not very likely to hold his tongue, we were in the greater       impatience to be gone ourselves.            The day came to an end with the same brightness; the night fell quiet and       clear; lights came out in houses and hamlets and then, one after another,       began to be put out; but it was past eleven, and we were long since       strangely tortured with anxieties, before we heard the grinding of oars       upon the rowing-pins. At that, we looked out and saw the lass herself       coming rowing to us in a boat. She had trusted no one with our affairs,       not even her sweetheart, if she had one; but as soon as her father was       asleep, had left the house by a window, stolen a neighbour’s boat, and       come to our assistance single-handed.            I was abashed how to find expression for my thanks; but she was no less       abashed at the thought of hearing them; begged us to lose no time and to       hold our peace, saying (very properly) that the heart of our matter was in       haste and silence; and so, what with one thing and another, she had set us       on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden, had shaken hands with us, and       was out again at sea and rowing for Limekilns, before there was one word       said either of her service or our gratitude.            Even after she was gone, we had nothing to say, as indeed nothing was       enough for such a kindness. Only Alan stood a great while upon the shore       shaking his head.     ",421_45.jpg

Here he sate down, and bade me be seated;       though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my       muddy rags. “And now,” says he, “if you have any business, pray be brief       and come swiftly to the point. Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo—do       you understand that?” says he, with a keen look.     ",421_47.jpg
671,0,671_0.jpg,"       As soon as we were past the Hawes (where I recognised the landlord smoking       his pipe in the door, and was amazed to see him look no older) Mr.       Rankeillor changed the order of march, walking behind with Torrance and       sending me forward in the manner of a scout. I went up the hill, whistling       from time to time my Gaelic air; and at length I had the pleasure to hear       it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush. He was somewhat       dashed in spirits, having passed a long day alone skulking in the county,       and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas. But at the mere sight       of my clothes, he began to brighten up; and as soon as I had told him in       what a forward state our matters were and the part I looked to him to play       in what remained, he sprang into a new man.            “And that is a very good notion of yours,” says he; “and I dare to say       that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than       Alan Breck. It is not a thing (mark ye) that any one could do, but takes a       gentleman of penetration. But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man will be       somewhat wearying to see me,” says Alan.            Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor, who came up alone and was       presented to my friend, Mr. Thomson.            “Mr. Thomson, I am pleased to meet you,” said he. “But I have forgotten my       glasses; and our friend, Mr. David here” (clapping me on the shoulder),       “will tell you that I am little better than blind, and that you must not       be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow.”             This he said, thinking that Alan would be pleased; but the Highlandman’s       vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that.            “Why, sir,” says he, stiffly, “I would say it mattered the less as we are       met here for a particular end, to see justice done to Mr. Balfour; and by       what I can see, not very likely to have much else in common. But I accept       your apology, which was a very proper one to make.”             “And that is more than I could look for, Mr. Thomson,” said Rankeillor,       heartily. “And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise, I       think we should come into a nice agreement; to which end, I propose that       you should lend me your arm, for (what with the dusk and the want of my       glasses) I am not very clear as to the path; and as for you, Mr. David,       you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with. Only let me       remind you, it’s quite needless he should hear more of your adventures or       those of—ahem—Mr. Thomson.”             Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk, and Torrance and I       brought up the rear.

671,2,671_2.jpg,"       “What do ye mean?” cried Ebenezer. “Did Hoseason tell ye?”             “Why, ye donnered auld runt, how else would I ken?” cried Alan. “Hoseason       and me are partners; we gang shares; so ye can see for yoursel’ what good       ye can do leeing. And I must plainly say ye drove a fool’s bargain when ye       let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters. But       that’s past praying for; and ye must lie on your bed the way ye made it.       And the point in hand is just this: what did ye pay him?”             “Has he tauld ye himsel’?” asked my uncle.            “That’s my concern,” said Alan.            “Weel,” said my uncle, “I dinnae care what he said, he leed, and the       solemn God’s truth is this, that I gave him twenty pound. But I’ll be       perfec’ly honest with ye: forby that, he was to have the selling of the       lad in Caroliny, whilk would be as muckle mair, but no from my pocket, ye       see.”             “Thank you, Mr. Thomson. That will do excellently well,” said the lawyer,       stepping forward; and then mighty civilly, “Good-evening, Mr. Balfour,”        said he.            And, “Good-evening, Uncle Ebenezer,” said I.            And, “It’s a braw nicht, Mr. Balfour,” added Torrance.     ",421_50.jpg
671,3,671_3.jpg,"       “Not many, sir,” said I, smiling.            “Why, yes, sir,” he cried, “very many. And it would be ten times better       for your uncle (to go no farther afield) if he were dangling decently upon       a gibbet.”             Thereupon he turned into the house (still in a great fervour of mind, so       that I saw I had pleased him heartily) and there he wrote me two letters,       making his comments on them as he wrote.            “This,” says he, “is to my bankers, the British Linen Company, placing a       credit to your name. Consult Mr. Thomson, he will know of ways; and you,       with this credit, can supply the means. I trust you will be a good husband       of your money; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson, I would be       even prodigal. Then for his kinsman, there is no better way than that you       should seek the Advocate, tell him your tale, and offer testimony; whether       he may take it or not, is quite another matter, and will turn on the D. of       A. Now, that you may reach the Lord Advocate well recommended, I give you       here a letter to a namesake of your own, the learned Mr. Balfour of       Pilrig, a man whom I esteem. It will look better that you should be       presented by one of your own name; and the laird of Pilrig is much looked       up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord Advocate Grant. I would not       trouble him, if I were you, with any particulars; and (do you know?) I       think it would be needless to refer to Mr. Thomson. Form yourself upon the       laird, he is a good model; when you deal with the Advocate, be discreet;       and in all these matters, may the Lord guide you, Mr. David!”             Thereupon he took his farewell, and set out with Torrance for the Ferry,       while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh. As we went by       the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge, we kept       looking back at the house of my fathers. It stood there, bare and great       and smokeless, like a place not lived in; only in one of the top windows,       there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward,       like the head of a rabbit from a burrow. I had little welcome when I came,       and less kindness while I stayed; but at least I was watched as I went       away.            Alan and I went slowly forward upon our way, having little heart either to       walk or speak. The same thought was uppermost in both, that we were near       the time of our parting; and remembrance of all the bygone days sate upon       us sorely. We talked indeed of what should be done; and it was resolved       that Alan should keep to the county, biding now here, now there, but       coming once in the day to a particular place where I might be able to       communicate with him, either in my own person or by messenger. In the       meanwhile, I was to seek out a lawyer, who was an Appin Stewart, and a man       therefore to be wholly trusted; and it should be his part to find a ship       and to arrange for Alan’s safe embarkation. No sooner was this business       done, than the words seemed to leave us; and though I would seek to jest       with Alan under the name of Mr. Thomson, and he with me on my new clothes       and my estate, you could feel very well that we were nearer tears than       laughter.            We came the by-way over the hill of Corstorphine; and when we got near to       the place called Rest-and-be-Thankful, and looked down on Corstorphine       bogs and over to the city and the castle on the hill, we both stopped, for       we both knew without a word said that we had come to where our ways       parted. Here he repeated to me once again what had been agreed upon       between us: the address of the lawyer, the daily hour at which Alan might       be found, and the signals that were to be made by any that came seeking       him. Then I gave what money I had (a guinea or two of Rankeillor’s) so       that he should not starve in the meanwhile; and then we stood a space, and       looked over at Edinburgh in silence.            “Well, good-bye,” said Alan, and held out his left hand.

676,0,676_3.jpg,"         The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,         tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail,         and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was         clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail;         and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys,         padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body         was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his         waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.                Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had         never believed it until now.                No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through         and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling         influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the         folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not         observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his         senses.                “How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What         do you want with me?”                “Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.                “Ask me who I  you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice.         “You’re particular, for a shade.” He was going to say         “ a shade,” but substituted this, as more         appropriate.       ",46_0.jpg
676,1,676_1.jpg,"         Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he         could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the         night became as it had been when he walked home.                Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had         entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,         and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!”         but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had         undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible         World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the         hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing,         and fell asleep upon the instant. ",46_1.jpg
676,2,676_2.jpg,"         But if they had been twice as many—ah, four times—old         Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig.         As to , she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the         term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll         use it. A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves.         They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t         have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next.         And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;         advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey,         corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig         “cut”—cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his         legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.                When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.         Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and         shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out,         wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the         two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful         voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under         a counter in the back-shop.                During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his         wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He         corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and         underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright         faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he         remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon         him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.                “A small matter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly         folks so full of gratitude.”                The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were         pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so,         said,                “Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal         money: three or four perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this         praise?”                “It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark,         and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.         “It isn’t that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy         or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a         toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight         and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count ’em up:         what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a         fortune.”       ",46_2.jpg
676,3,676_3.jpg,"         “You have never seen the like of me before!” exclaimed the         Spirit.                “Never,” Scrooge made answer to it.                “Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family;         meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later         years?” pursued the Phantom.                “I don’t think I have,” said Scrooge. “I am         afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?”                “More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.                “A tremendous family to provide for!” muttered Scrooge.

677,3,677_3.jpg,"ONCE upon a time, many years ago—when our grandfathers were little children—there was a doctor; and his name was Dolittle—John Dolittle, M.D. “M.D.” means that he was a proper doctor and knew a whole lot.He lived in a little town called, Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. All the folks, young and old, knew him well by sight. And whenever he walked down the street in his high hat everyone would say, “There goes the Doctor!—He’s a clever man.” And the dogs and the children would all run up and follow behind him; and",501_3.jpg
678,0,678_0.jpg," to see him any more, but drove every Saturday all the way to Oxenthorpe, another town ten miles off, to see a different doctor.“And she never came to see him any more”Then his sister, Sarah Dolittle, came to him and said,“John, how can you expect sick people to come and see you when you keep all these animals in the house? It’s a fine doctor would have his parlor full of hedgehogs and mice! That’s the fourth personage these animals have driven away. Squire Jenkins and the Parson say they wouldn’t come near your house again—no matter how sick they are. We are getting poorer every day. If you go on like this, none of the best people will have you for a doctor.”“But I like the animals better than the ‘best people’,” said the Doctor.“You are ridiculous,” said his sister, and walked out of the room.So, as time went on, the Doctor got more and more animals; and the people who came to see him got less and less. Till at last he had no one left—except the Cat’s-meat-Man, who didn’t mind any kind of animals. But the Cat’s-meat-Man",501_4.jpg
678,1,678_1.jpg,"IT happened one day that the Doctor was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat’s-meat-Man who had come to see him with a stomach-ache.“Why don’t you give up being a people’s doctor, and be an animal-doctor?” asked the Cat’s-meat-Man.The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals—much more than what these here vets do. That book you wrote—about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe  write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar,",501_5.jpg
678,2,678_2.jpg,"“Oh, no,” said the horse. “I kicked him in the right place. The vet’s looking after him now. When will my glasses be ready?”“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”“He could see as well as ever”Then John Dolittle got a fine, big pair of green spectacles; and the plow-horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see as well as ever.And soon it became a common sight to see farm-animals wearing glasses in the country round Puddleby; and a blind horse was a thing unknown.",501_6.jpg
678,3,678_3.jpg,"And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to him. As soon as they found that he could talk their language, they told him where the pain was and how they felt, and of course it was easy for him to cure them.“They came at once to his house on the edge of the town”Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big garden who really  a doctor. And whenever any creatures got sick—not only horses and cows and",501_7.jpg
679,0,679_0.jpg,"AND soon now the Doctor began to make money again; and his sister, Sarah, bought a new dress and was happy.Some of the animals who came to see him were so sick that they had to stay at the Doctor’s house for a week. And when they were getting better they used to sit in chairs on the lawn.",501_8.jpg

And when they were getting better they used to sit in chairs on the lawn.“They used to sit in chairs on the lawn”And often even after they got well, they did not want to go away—they liked the Doctor",501_9.jpg
679,2,679_2.jpg," It can’t be helped.” And he took down his hat and went out into the garden.So Sarah Dolittle packed up her things and went off; and the Doctor was left all alone with his animal family.“‘All right,’ said the Doctor, ‘go and get married’”And very soon he was poorer than he had ever been before. With all these mouths to fill, and the house to look after, and no one to do the mending, and no money coming in to pay the butcher’s bill, things began to look very difficult. But the Doctor didn’t worry at all.",501_10.jpg
679,3,679_3.jpg,"“Money is a nuisance,” he used to say. “We’d all be much better off if it had never been invented. What does money matter, so long as we are happy?”“One evening when the Doctor was asleep in his chair”But soon the animals themselves began to get worried. And one evening when the Doctor was asleep in his chair before the kitchen-fire",501_11.jpg
680,0,680_0.jpg,"A MESSAGE FROM AFRICATHAT Winter was a very cold one. And one night in December, when they were all sitting round the warm fire in the kitchen, and the Doctor was reading aloud to them out of books he had written himself in animal-language, the owl, Too-Too, suddenly said,“Sh! What’s that noise outside?”They all listened; and presently they heard the sound of some one running. Then the door flew open and the monkey, Chee-Chee, ran in, badly out of breath.“Doctor!” he cried, “I’ve just had a message from a cousin of mine in Africa. There is a terrible sickness among the monkeys out there. They are all catching it—and they are dying in hundreds. They have heard of you, and beg you to come to Africa to stop the sickness.”",501_12.jpg
680,1,680_1.jpg,"” said the owl. “But you spent it on a rattle for that badger’s baby when he was teething.”“Did I?” said the Doctor—“dear me, dear me! What a nuisance money is, to be sure! Well, never mind. Perhaps if I go down to the seaside I shall be able to borrow a boat that will take us to Africa. I knew a seaman once who brought his baby to me with measles. Maybe he’ll lend us his boat—the baby got well.”“‘I felt sure there was twopence left’”So early the next morning the Doctor went down to the sea-shore. And when he came back",501_13.jpg
680,2,680_2.jpg," “I’m too excited. I want to go upstairs again and see them start.”“And the voyage began”“Well, this is your first trip,” said Polynesia. “You will get used to the life after a while.” And she went back up the stairs of the ship, humming this song to herself,I’ve seen the Black Sea and the Red Sea;I rounded the Isle of Wight;I discovered the Yellow River,And the Orange too—by night.Now Greenland drops behind again,And I sail the ocean Blue.",501_14.jpg
680,3,680_3.jpg,"NOW for six whole weeks they went sailing on and on, over the rolling sea, following the swallow who flew before the ship to show them the way. At night she carried a tiny lantern, so they should not miss her in the dark; and the people on the other ships that passed said that the light must be a shooting star.As they sailed further and further into the South, it got warmer and warmer. Polynesia, Chee-Chee and the crocodile enjoyed the hot sun no end. They ran about laughing and looking over the side of the ship to see if they could see Africa yet.But the pig and the dog and the owl, Too-Too, could do nothing in such weather, but sat at the end of the ship in the shade of a big",501_15.jpg
681,0,681_0.jpg," and we’ll hold the other end on the ship here. Then those that can’t swim must climb along the rope till they reach the land. That’s what you call a ‘life-line.’”“‘We must have run into Africa’”So they all got safely to the shore—some swimming, some flying; and those that climbed along the rope brought the Doctor’s trunk and hand-bag with them.But the ship was no good any more—with the",501_16.jpg
681,1,681_1.jpg,"“Sh! I hear footsteps in the jungle!”They all stopped talking and listened. And soon a black man came down out of the woods and asked them what they were doing there.“‘I got into it because I did not want to be drowned’”“My name is John Dolittle—M.D.,” said the Doctor. “I have been asked to come to Africa to cure the monkeys who are sick.”",501_17.jpg
681,2,681_2.jpg,"POLYNESIA AND THE KINGWHEN they had gone a little way through the thick forest, they came to a wide, clear space; and they saw the King’s palace which was made of mud.This was where the King lived with his Queen, Ermintrude, and their son, Prince Bumpo. The Prince was away fishing for salmon in the river. But the King and Queen were sitting under an umbrella before the palace door. And Queen Ermintrude was asleep.When the Doctor had come up to the palace the King asked him his business; and the Doctor told him why he had come to Africa.“You may not travel through my lands,” said the King. “Many years ago a white man came",501_18.jpg
681,3,681_3.jpg," to these shores; and I was very kind to him. But after he had dug holes in the ground to get the gold, and killed all the elephants to get their ivory tusks, he went away secretly in his ship— without so much as saying ‘Thank you.’ Never again shall a white man travel through the lands of Jolliginki.”“And Queen Ermintrude was asleep”Then the King turned to some of the black men who were standing near and said, “Take",501_19.jpg
682,0,682_0.jpg,"“I am Doctor Dolittle,” said the parrot—just the way the Doctor would have said it.“What are you doing in my bedroom?” cried the King. “How dare you get out of prison! Where are you?—I don’t see you.”But the parrot just laughed—a long, deep* jolly laugh, like the Doctor’s.“Stop laughing and come here at once, so I can see you,” said the King.",501_20.jpg
682,1,682_1.jpg,"THE BRIDGE OF APESQUEEN ERMINTRUDE had never in her life seen her husband so terrible as he got that night. He gnashed his teeth with rage. He called everybody a fool. He threw his tooth-brush at the palace cat. He rushed round in his night-shirt and woke up all his army and sent them into the jungle to catch the Doctor. Then he made all his servants go too—his cooks and his gardeners and his barber and Prince Bumpo’s tutor—even the Queen, who was tired from dancing in a pair of tight shoes, was packed off to help the soldiers in their search.All this time the Doctor and his animals were running through the forest towards the Land of the Monkeys as fast as they could go.Gub-Gub, with his short legs, soon got tired; and the Doctor had to carry him—which made",501_21.jpg

And as he sprang forward to take hold of the Doctor, one of his ears caught fast in a tree; and the rest of the army had to stop and help him.By this time the Doctor had picked himself up, and on they went again, running and running. And Chee-Chee shouted,“It’s all right! We haven’t far to go now!”But before they could get into the Land of the Monkeys, they came to a steep cliff with a river flowing below. This was the end of the Kingdom of Jolliginki; and the Land of the Monkeys was on the other side—across the river.And Jip, the dog, looked down over the edge of the steep, steep cliff and said,",501_22.jpg

That often happens to proud people.”ME, the King of Beasts, to wait on a lot of dirty monkeys?’”“The lions are never  trouble,” said the Leader, turning up his nose. And he stalked away into the jungle, feeling he had been rather smart and clever.Then the leopards got proud too and said they wouldn’t help. And then of course the",501_25.jpg
683,2,683_2.jpg,"CHEE-CHEE stood outside the Doctor’s door, keeping everybody away till he woke up. Then John Dolittle told the monkeys that he must now go back to Puddleby.They were very surprised at this; for they had thought that he was going to stay with them forever. And that night all the monkeys got together in the jungle to talk it over.And the Chief Chimpanzee rose up and said,“Why is it the good man is going away? Is he not happy here with us?”But none of them could answer him.Then the Grand Gorilla got up and said,“I think we all should go to him and ask him to stay. Perhaps if we make him a new house and a bigger bed, and promise him plenty",501_26.jpg

Look! Chee-Chee, the great Traveler, is about to speak!”And Chee-Chee said to the other monkeys,“My friends, I am afraid it is useless to ask the Doctor to stay. He owes money in Puddleby; and he says he must go back and pay it.”And the monkeys asked him, “What is Then Chee-Chee told them that in the Land of the White Men you could get nothing without money; you could ",501_27.jpg
684,0,684_0.jpg,"THE RAREST ANIMAL OF ALLPUSHMI-PULLYUS are now extinct. That means, there aren’t any more. But long ago, when Doctor Dolittle was alive, there were some of them still left in the deepest jungles of Africa; and even then they were very, very scarce. They had no tail, but a head at each end, and sharp horns on each head. They were very shy and terribly hard to catch. The black men get most of their animals by sneaking up behind them while they are not looking. But you could not do this with the pushmi-pullyu—because, no matter which way you came towards him, he was always facing you. And besides, only one half of him slept at a time. The other head was always awake—and watching. This was why they were never caught and never seen in",501_28.jpg

684,2,684_2.jpg,"BY the edge of the river they stopped and said farewell.This took a long time, because all those thousands of monkeys wanted to shake John Dolittle by the hand.Afterwards, when the Doctor and his pets were going on alone, Polynesia said,“We must tread softly and talk low as we go through the land of the Jolliginki. If the King should hear us, he will send his soldiers to catch us again; for I am sure he is still very angry over the trick I played on him.”“What I am wondering,” said the Doctor, “is where we are going to get another boat to go home in.... Oh well, perhaps we’ll find one lying about on the beach that nobody is using. ‘Never lift your foot till you come to the stile.’”",501_30.jpg
684,3,684_3.jpg," and began reading the fairy-stories to himself.Chee-Chee and Polynesia watched him, keeping very quiet and still.“He began reading the fairy-stories to himself”After a while the King’s son laid the book down and sighed a weary sigh.",501_31.jpg
685,0,685_0.jpg,"VERY, very quietly, making sure that no one should see her, Polynesia then slipped out at the back of the tree and flew across to the prison.She found Gub-Gub poking his nose through the bars of the window, trying to sniff the cooking-smells that came from the palace-kitchen. She told the pig to bring the Doctor to the window because she wanted to speak to him. So Gub-Gub went and woke the Doctor who was taking a nap.“Listen,” whispered the parrot, when John Dolittle’s face appeared: “Prince Bumpo is coming here to-night to see you. And you’ve got to find some way to turn him white. But be sure to make him promise you first that he",501_32.jpg

Now we need not be afraid that we will lose our way upon the sea.... Pull up the anchor and set the sail!”“Crying bitterly and waving till the ship was out of sight”When the ship moved out upon the water, those who stayed behind, Chee-Chee, Polynesia and the crocodile, grew terribly sad. For never in their lives had they known any one they liked so well as Doctor John Dolittle of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh.",501_33.jpg
685,2,685_2.jpg,"RED SAILS AND BLUE WINGSSAILING homeward, the Doctor’s ship had to pass the coast of Barbary. This coast is the seashore of the Great Desert. It is a wild, lonely place—all sand and stones. And it was here that the Barbary pirates lived.These pirates, a bad lot of men, used to wait for sailors to be shipwrecked on their shores. And often, if they saw a boat passing, they would come out in their fast sailing-ships and chase it. When they caught a boat like this at sea, they would steal everything on it; and after they had taken the people off they would sink the ship and sail back to Barbary singing songs and feeling proud of the mischief they had done. Then they used to make the people they had caught write home to their friends for money. And if",501_34.jpg
685,3,685_3.jpg," said the Doctor, “so we can go faster and get away from them. Run downstairs, Jip, and fetch me all the sails you see.”The dog hurried downstairs and dragged up every sail he could find.“‘They are surely the pirates of Barbary’”But even when all these were put up on the masts to catch the wind, the boat did not go nearly as fast as the pirates’—which kept coming on behind, closer and closer.“This is a poor ship the Prince gave us,” said Gub-Gub, the pig—“the slowest he could find, I",501_35.jpg
686,0,686_0.jpg,"DRAGGING a ship through the sea is hard work. And after two or three hours the swallows began to get tired in the wings and short of breath. Then they sent a message down to the Doctor to say that they would have to take a rest soon; and that they would pull the boat over to an island not far off, and hide it in a deep bay till they had got breath enough to go on.And presently the Doctor saw the island they had spoken of. It had a very beautiful, high, green mountain in the middle of it.When the ship had sailed safely into the bay where it could not be seen from the open sea, the Doctor said he would get off on to the island to look for water—because there was none left",501_36.jpg
686,1,686_1.jpg," But you can’t blame us, can you? After all, who  stay on a sinking ship, if he could get off it?”“‘And you have heard that rats always leave a sinking ship?’”“It’s very natural,” said the Doctor—“very natural. I quite understand.... Was there—Was there anything else you wished to say?”",501_37.jpg
686,2,686_2.jpg,"EVERYTHING would have gone all right if the pig had not caught a cold in his head while eating the damp sugar-cane on the island. This is what happened:After they had pulled up the anchor without a sound, and were moving the ship very, very carefully out of the bay, Gub-Gub suddenly sneezed so loud that the pirates on the other ship came rushing upstairs to see what the noise was.As soon as they saw that the Doctor was escaping, they sailed the other boat right across the entrance to the bay so that the Doctor could not get out into the open sea.Then the leader of these bad men (who called himself “Ben Ali, The Dragon”) shook his fist at the Doctor and shouted across the water,",501_38.jpg

Look here, Ben Ali—”But before the Doctor could say any more, the pirates began to sail the ship nearer, laughing with glee, and saying one to another, “Who shall be the first to catch the pig?”",501_39.jpg
687,0,687_0.jpg,"HAVING thanked the sharks again for their kindness, the Doctor and his pets set off once more on their journey home in the swift ship with the three red sails.As they moved out into the open sea, the animals all went downstairs to see what their new boat was like inside; while the Doctor leant on the rail at the back of the ship with a pipe in his mouth, watching the Canary Islands fade away in the blue dusk of the evening.While he was standing there, wondering how the monkeys were getting on—and what his garden would look like when he got back to Puddleby, Dab-Dab came tumbling up the stairs, all smiles and full of news.“Doctor!” she cried. “This ship of the pirates",501_40.jpg
687,1,687_1.jpg,"“Sh!—Listen!—I do believe there’s some one in there!”They all kept still a moment. Then the Doctor said,“‘Sh!—Listen!—I do believe there’s some one in there!’”“You must be mistaken, Too-Too. I don’t hear anything.”“I’m sure of it,” said the owl. “Sh!—There it is again—Don’t you hear that?”“No, I do not,” said the Doctor. “What kind of a sound is it?”",501_41.jpg
687,2,687_2.jpg,"RIGHT away an axe was found. And the Doctor soon chopped a hole in the door big enough to clamber through.At first he could see nothing at all, it was so dark inside. So he struck a match.The room was quite small; no window; the ceiling, low. For furniture there was only one little stool. All round the room big barrels stood against the walls, fastened at the bottom so they wouldn’t tumble with the rolling of the ship; and above the barrels, pewter jugs of all sizes hung from wooden pegs. There was a strong, winey smell. And in the middle of the floor sat a little boy, about eight years old, crying bitterly.“I declare, it is the pirates’ rum-room!” said Jip in a whisper.",501_42.jpg
687,3,687_3.jpg,"“YOUR uncle must now be ,” said the Doctor—“that is the next thing—now that we know he wasn’t thrown into the sea.”Then Dab-Dab came up to him again and whispered,“Ask the eagles to look for the man. No living creature can see better than an eagle. When they are miles high in the air they can count the ants crawling on the ground. Ask the eagles.”So the Doctor sent one of the swallows off to get some eagles.And in about an hour the little bird came back with six different kinds of eagles: a Black Eagle, a Bald Eagle, a Fish Eagle, a Golden Eagle, an Eagle-Vulture, and a White-tailed Sea Eagle.

Then he came to the Doctor, shaking his head.“I smell no snuff as yet,” he said. “We must wait till the wind changes to the East.”But even when the East wind came, at three o’clock that afternoon, the dog could not catch the smell of snuff.The little boy was terribly disappointed and began to cry again, saying that no one seemed to be able to find his uncle for him. But all Jip said to the Doctor was,“Tell him that when the wind changes to",501_45.jpg

And the wind was soft and warm and wet.“‘Doctor!’ he cried. ‘I’ve got it!’”As soon as Jip awoke he ran upstairs and poked his nose in the air. Then he got most frightfully excited and rushed down again to wake the Doctor up.“Doctor!” he cried. “I’ve got it! Doctor!",501_46.jpg

He had not hurt him much though—because it was too dark to punch properly. Then he gave the Doctor a pinch of snuff.And the man told how the Barbary Dragon had put him on to this rock and left him there, when he wouldn’t promise to become a pirate; and how he used to sleep down in this hole because",501_47.jpg

First he went traveling through the land with the pushmi-pullyu in a gipsy-wagon, stopping at all the country-fairs. And there, with the acrobats on one side of them and the Punch-and-Judy show on the other, they would hang out a big sign which read, “Come and See the Marvelous Two-Headed Animal from the Jungles of Africa.And the pushmi-pullyu would stay inside the wagon, while the other animals would lie about",501_49.jpg

The Doctor sat in a chair in front taking the sixpences and smiling on the people as they went in; and Dab-Dab was kept busy all the time scolding him because he would let the children in for nothing when she wasn’t looking.And menagerie-keepers and circus-men came and asked the Doctor to sell them the strange creature, saying they would pay a tremendous lot of money for him. But the Doctor always shook his head and said,“No. The pushmi-pullyu shall never be shut up in a cage. He shall be free always to come and go, like you and me.”Many curious sights and happenings they saw in this wandering life; but they all seemed quite ordinary after the great things they had seen and done in foreign lands. It was very interesting at first, being sort of part of a circus; but after a few weeks they all got dreadfully tired of it and the Doctor and all of them were longing to go home.“The Doctor sat in a chair in front”But so many people came flocking to the little wagon and paid the sixpence to go inside and",501_50.jpg

And Dab-Dab was glad, too, to get back to the house she knew so well—although there was a terrible lot of dusting to be done, with cobwebs everywhere.And after Jip had gone and shown his golden collar to the conceited collie next-door, he came back and began running round the garden like a crazy thing, looking for the bones he had buried long ago, and chasing the rats out of the tool-shed; while Gub-Gub dug up the horseradish which had grown three feet high in the corner by the garden-wall.“He began running round the garden like a crazy thing”And the Doctor went and saw the sailor who had lent him the boat, and he bought two new ships for him and a rubber-doll for his baby;",501_51.jpg

690,2,690_2.jpg,"Elizabeth Ann stood up before the doctor.The doctor said back to her, as he put on his hat, all the things doctors always say under such conditions: ""More beefsteak ... plenty of fresh air ... more sleep ... ll be all right ..."" but his voice did not sound as though he thought what he was saying amounted to much. Nor did Elizabeth Ann. She had hoped for some spectacular red pills to be taken every half-hour, like those Grace's doctor gave her whenever she felt low in her mind.And just then something happened which changed Elizabeth Ann's life forever and ever. It was a very small thing, too. Aunt Harriet coughed. Elizabeth Ann did not think it at all a bad-sounding cough in comparison with Grace's hollow whoop; Aunt Harriet had been coughing like that ever since the cold weather set in, for three or four months now, and nobody had thought anything of it, because they were all so much occupied in taking care of the sensitive, nervous little girl who needed so much care.And yet, at the sound of that little discreet cough behind Aunt Harriet's hand, the doctor whirled around and fixed his sharp eyes on her, with all the bored, impatient look gone, the first time Elizabeth Ann had ever seen him look interested. ""What's that? What's that?"" he said, going over quickly to Aunt Harriet. He snatched out of his little bag a shiny thing with two rubber tubes attached, and he put the ends of the tubes in his ears and the shiny thing up against Aunt Harriet, who was saying, ""It's nothing, Doctor ... a little teasing cough I've had this winter. And I meant to tell you, too, but I forgot it, that that sore spot on my lungs doesn't go away as it ought to.""The doctor motioned her very impolitely to stop talking, and listened very hard through his little tubes. Then he turned around and looked at Aunt Frances as though he were angry at her. He said, ""Take the child away and then come back here yourself.""And that was almost all that Elizabeth Ann ever knew of the forces which swept her away from the life which had always gone on, revolving about her small person, exactly the same ever since she could remember.You have heard so much about tears in the account of Elizabeth Ann's life so far that I won't tell you much about the few days which followed, as the family talked over and hurriedly prepared to obey the doctor's verdict, which was that Aunt Harriet was very, very sick and must go away at once to a warm climate, and Aunt Frances must go, too, but not Elizabeth Ann, for Aunt Frances would need to give all her time to taking care of Aunt Harriet. And anyhow the doctor didn't think it best, either for Aunt Harriet or for Elizabeth Ann, to have them in the same house.",5347_2.jpg
690,3,690_3.jpg,"""Do you know,"" said Aunt Abigail, ""I think it's going to be real nice, having a little girl in the house again.""Aunt Abigail laid down her book and looked over at the child. ""Do you know,"" she said, in a conversational tone, ""do you know, I think it's going to be real nice, having a little girl in the house again.""Oh, then the tight knot in the little unwanted girl's heart was loosened indeed! It all gave way at once, and Elizabeth Ann burst suddenly into hot tears—yes, I know I said I would not tell you any more about her crying; but these tears were very different from any she had ever shed before. And they were the last, too, for a long, long time.Aunt Abigail said, ""Well, well!"" and moving over in bed took the little weeping girl into her arms. She did not say another word then, but she put her soft, withered old cheek close against Elizabeth Ann's, till the sobs began to grow less, and then she said: ""I hear your kitty crying outside the door. Shall I let her in? I expect she'd like to sleep with you. I guess there's room for three of us.""She got out of bed as she spoke and walked across the room to the door. The floor shook under her great bulk, and the peak of her nightcap made a long, grotesque shadow. But as she came back with the kitten in her arms Elizabeth Ann saw nothing funny in her looks. She gave Eleanor to the little girl and got into bed again. ""There, now, I guess we're ready for the night,"" she said. ""You put the kitty on the other side of you so she won't fall out of bed.""She blew the light out and moved over a little closer to Elizabeth. Ann, who immediately was enveloped in that delicious warmth. The kitten curled up under the little girl's chin. Between her and the terrors of the dark room loomed the rampart of Aunt Abigail's great body.Elizabeth Ann drew a long, long breath ... and when she opened her eyes the sun was shining in at the window.",5347_3.jpg
691,0,691_0.jpg,"She had greatly enjoyed doing her own hair.Cousin Ann set her iron down with the soft thump which Elizabeth Ann had heard upstairs. She began folding a napkin, and said: ""Now reach yourself a bowl off the shelf yonder. The oatmeal's in that kettle on the stove and the milk is in the blue pitcher. If you want a piece of bread and butter, here's a new loaf just out of the oven, and the butter's in that brown crock.""Elizabeth Ann followed these instructions and sat down before this quickly assembled breakfast in a very much surprised silence. At home it took the girl more than half an hour to get breakfast and set the table, and then she had to wait on them besides. She began to pour the milk out of the pitcher and stopped suddenly. ""Oh, I'm afraid I've taken more than my share!"" she said apologetically.Cousin Ann looked up from her rapidly moving iron, and said, in an astonished voice: ""Your share? What do you mean?""""My share of the quart,"" explained Elizabeth Ann. At home they bought a quart of milk and a cup of cream every day, and they were all very conscientious about not taking more than their due share.""Good land, child, take all the  you want!"" said Cousin Ann, as though she found something shocking in what the little girl had just said. Elizabeth Ann thought to herself that she spoke as though milk ran out of a faucet, like water.She was very fond of milk, and she made a very good breakfast as she sat looking about the low-ceilinged room. It was unlike any room she had ever seen.",5347_4.jpg
691,1,691_1.jpg,"""Oh, he's asking for more'"" cried Elizabeth AnnThere was the sound of the telephone receiver being hung up in the next room—and everybody acted at once. Aunt Abigail began drinking innocently out of her coffee-cup, only her laughing old eyes showing over the rim; Uncle Henry buttered a slice of bread with a grave face, as though he were deep in conjectures about who would be the next President; and as for old Shep, he made one plunge across the room, his toe-nails clicking rapidly on the bare floor, sprang up on the couch, and when Cousin Ann opened the door and came in he was lying in exactly the position in which she had left him, his paw stretched out, his head laid on it, his brown eyes turned up meekly so that the whites showed.I've told you what these three did, but I haven't told you yet what Elizabeth Ann did. And it is worth telling. As Cousin Ann stepped in, glancing suspiciously from her sober-faced and abstracted parents to the lamb-like innocence of old Shep, little Elizabeth Ann burst into a shout of laughter. It's worth telling about, because, so far as I know, that was the first time she had ever laughed out heartily in all her life. For my part, I'm half surprised to know that she knew how.Of course, when she laughed, Aunt Abigail had to laugh too, setting down her coffee-cup and showing all the funny wrinkles in her face screwed up hard with fun; and that made Uncle Henry laugh, and then Cousin Ann laughed and said, as she sat down, ""You are bad children, the whole four of you!"" And old Shep, seeing the state of things, stopped pretending to be meek, jumped down, and came lumbering over to the table, wagging his tail and laughing too; you know that good, wide dog-smile! He put his head on Elizabeth Ann's lap again and she patted it and lifted up one of his big black ears. She had quite forgotten that she was terribly afraid of big dogs.After dinner Cousin Ann looked up at the clock and said: ""My goodness! Betsy'll be late for school if she doesn't start right off."" She explained to the child, aghast at this sudden thunderclap, ""I let you sleep this morning as long as you wanted to, because you were so tired from your journey. But of course there's no reason for missing the afternoon session.""As Elizabeth Ann continued sitting perfectly still, frozen with alarm, Cousin Ann jumped up briskly, got the little coat and cap, helped her up, and began inserting the child's arms into the sleeves. She pulled the cap well down over Elizabeth Ann's ears, felt in the pocket and pulled out the mittens. ""There,"" she said, holding them out, ""you'd better put them on before you go out, for it's a real cold day."" As she led the stupefied little girl along toward the door Aunt Abigail came after them and put a big sugar-cookie into the child's hand. ""Maybe you'll like to eat that for your recess time,"" she said. ""I always did when I went to school.""Elizabeth Ann's hand closed automatically about the cookie, but she scarcely heard what was said. She felt herself to be in a bad dream. Aunt Frances had never, no , let her go to school alone, and on the first day of the year always took her to the new teacher and introduced her and told the teacher how sensitive she was and how hard to understand; and then she stayed there for an hour or two till Elizabeth Ann got used to things! She could not face a whole new school all alone—oh, she couldn't, she wouldn't! She couldn't! Horrors! Here she was in the front hall—she was on the porch! Cousin Ann was saying: ""Now run along, child. Straight down the road till the first turn to the left, and there in the cross-roads, there you are."" And now the front door closed behind her, the path stretched before her to the road, and the road led down the hill the way Cousin Ann had pointed. Elizabeth Ann's feet began to move forward and carried her down the path, although she was still crying out to herself, ""I can't! I won't! I can't!""",5347_5.jpg

It was only a poor, rough, little district school anyway, that no Superintendent of Schools would have looked at for a minute, except to sniff.",5347_6.jpg
691,3,691_3.jpg,"""What's the matter, Molly? What's the matter?""Do you know what she did, right off, without thinking about it? She didn't go and look up Aunt Abigail. She didn't wait till Uncle Henry came back from his round of emptying sap buckets into the big tub on his sled. As fast as her feet could carry her she flew back to Cousin Ann in the sap-house. I can't tell you (except again that Cousin Ann was Cousin Ann) why it was that Betsy ran so fast to her and was so sure that everything would be all right as soon as Cousin Ann knew about it; but whatever the reason was it was a good one, for, though Cousin Ann did not stop to kiss Molly or even to look at her more than one sharp first glance, she said after a moment's pause, during which she filled a syrup can and screwed the cover down very tight: ""Well, if her folks will let her stay, how would you like to have Molly come and stay with us till her mother gets back from the hospital? Now you've got a room of your own, I guess if you wanted to you could have her sleep with you.""""Oh, Molly, Molly, Molly!"" shouted Betsy, jumping up and down, and then hugging the little girl with all her might. ""Oh, it will be like having a little sister!""Cousin Ann sounded a dry, warning note: ""Don't be too sure her folks will let her. We don't know about them yet.""Betsy ran to her, and caught her hand, looking up at her with shining eyes. ""Cousin Ann, if  go to see them and ask them, they will!""This made even Cousin Ann give a little abashed smile of pleasure, although she made her face grave again at once and said: ""You'd better go along back to the house now, Betsy. It's time for you to help Mother with the supper.""The two children trotted back along the darkening wood road, Shep running before them, little Molly clinging fast to the older child's hand. ""Aren't you ever afraid, Betsy, in the woods this way?"" she asked admiringly, looking about her with timid eyes.",5347_7.jpg
692,0,692_0.jpg,"Betsy and Ellen and the old doll.Finally, ""It's too cold to play up here,"" she said, coming to herself with a long breath. ""You'd better bring Deborah and the trunk down into the south room."" She carried the doll, and Betsy and Ellen each took an end of the old trunk, no larger than a modern suitcase. They settled themselves on the big couch, back of the table with the lamp. Old Shep was on it, but Betsy coaxed him off by putting down some bones Cousin Ann had been saving for him. When he finished those and came back for the rest of his snooze, he found his place occupied by the little girls, sitting cross-legged, examining the contents of the trunk, all spread out around them. Shep sighed deeply and sat down with his nose resting on the couch near Betsy's knee, following all their movements with his kind, dark eyes. Once in a while Betsy stopped hugging Deborah or exclaiming over a new dress long enough to pat Shep's head and fondle his ears. This was what he was waiting for, and every time she did it he wagged his tail thumpingly against the floor.After that Deborah and her trunk were kept downstairs where Betsy could play with her. And often she was taken to school. You never heard of such a thing as taking a doll to school, did you? Well, I told you this was a queer, old-fashioned school that any modern School Superintendent would sniff at. As a matter of fact, it was not only Betsy who took her doll to school; all the little girls did, whenever they felt like it. Miss Benton, the teacher, had a shelf for them in the entry-way where the wraps were hung, and the dolls sat on it and waited patiently all through lessons. At recess time or nooning each little mother snatched her own child and began to play. As soon as it grew warm enough to play outdoors without just racing around every minute to keep from freezing to death, the dolls and their mothers went out to a great pile of rocks at one end of the bare, stony field which was the playground.There they sat and played in the spring sunshine, warmer from day to day. There were a great many holes and shelves and pockets and little caves in the rocks which made lovely places for playing keep-house. Each little girl had her own particular cubby-holes and ""rooms,"" and they ""visited"" their dolls back and forth all around the pile. And as they played they talked very fast about all sorts of things, being little girls and not boys who just yelled and howled inarticulately as they played ball or duck-on-a-rock or prisoner's goal, racing and running and wrestling noisily all around the rocks.There was one child who neither played with the girls nor ran and whooped with the boys. This was little six-year-old 'Lias, one of the two boys in Molly's first grade. At recess time he generally hung about the school door by himself, looking moodily down and knocking the toe of his ragged, muddy shoe against a stone. The little girls were talking about him one day as they played. ""My! Isn't that 'Lias Brewster the horridest-looking child!"" said Eliza, who had the second grade all to herself, although Molly now read out of the second reader with her.""Mercy, yes! So ragged!"" said Anastasia Monahan, called Stashie for short. She was a big girl, fourteen years old, who was in the seventh grade.""He doesn't look as if he  combed his hair!"" said Betsy. ""It looks just like a wisp of old hay.""",5347_8.jpg
692,1,692_1.jpg,"He had fallen asleep with his head on his arms.As long as she lives Betsy will never forget what she saw that night through that window. Her eyes grew very hot and her hands very cold. Her heart thumped hard. She reached for little Molly and gave her a great hug in the darkness. Suppose it were little Molly asleep there, all alone in the dirty, dismal house, with no supper and nobody to put her to bed. She found that Ellen, next her, was crying quietly into the corner of her apron.Nobody said a word. Stashie, who had the bundle, walked around soberly to the front door, put it down, and knocked loudly. They all darted away noiselessly to the road, to the shadow of the trees, and waited until the door opened. A square of yellow light appeared, with 'Lias's figure, very small, at the bottom of it. They saw him stoop and pick up the bundle and go back into the house. Then they went quickly and silently back, separating at the cross-roads with no good-night greetings.Molly and Betsy began to climb the hill to Putney Farm. It was a very warm night for May, and little Molly began to puff for breath. ""Let's sit down on this rock awhile and rest,"" she said.They were half-way up the hill now. From the rock they could see the lights in the farmhouses scattered along the valley road and on the side of the mountain opposite them, like big stars fallen from the multitude above. Betsy lay down on the rock and looked up at the stars. After a silence little Molly's chirping voice said, ""Oh, I thought you said we were going to march up to 'Lias in school and give him his clothes. Did you forget about that?""Betsy gave a wriggle of shame as she remembered that plan. ""No, we didn't forget it,"" she said. ""We thought this would be a better way.""""But how'll 'Lias know who to thank?"" asked Molly.""That's no matter,"" said Betsy. Yes, it was Elizabeth-Ann-that-was who said that. And meant it, too. She was not even thinking of what she was saying. Between her and the stars, thick over her in the black, soft sky, she saw again that dirty, disordered room and the little boy, all alone, asleep with a piece of dry bread in his bony little fingers.",5347_9.jpg
692,2,692_2.jpg,"Never were dishes washed better!""My!"" said Molly, looking admiringly at Betsy's coolness over this transaction. Betsy went back to her dishes, stepping high.""Oh, Betsy, see! The pig! The big ox!"" cried Molly now, looking from her coign of vantage down the wide, grass-grown lane between the booths.Betsy craned her head around over her shoulder, continuing conscientiously to wash and wipe the dishes. The prize stock was being paraded around the Fair; the great prize ox, his shining horns tipped with blue rosettes; the prize cows, with wreaths around their necks; the prize horses, four or five of them as glossy as satin, curving their bright, strong necks and stepping as though on eggs, their manes and tails braided with bright ribbon; and then, ""Oh, Betsy,  at the pig!"" screamed Molly again—the smaller animals, the sheep, the calves, the colts, and the pig, which waddled along with portly dignity.Betsy looked as well as she could over her shoulder ... and in years to come she can shut her eyes and see again in every detail that rustic procession under the golden, September light.But she looked anxiously at the clock. It was nearing five. Oh, suppose the girl forgot and danced too long!""Two bottles of ginger ale and half a dozen doughnuts,"" said a man with a woman and three children.",5347_10.jpg
692,3,692_3.jpg,"Betsy was staring down at her shoes, biting her lips and winking her eyes.Betsy was the first to speak, and I'm very proud of her for what she said. She said, loyally, ""Dear Aunt Frances! She was always so sweet to me! She always tried so hard to take care of me!""For that was what Betsy had found up by the brook under the big red maple-tree. She had found there a certainty that, whatever else she did, she must  hurt Aunt Frances's feelings—dear, gentle, sweet Aunt Frances, whose feelings were so easily hurt and who had given her so many years of such anxious care. Something up there had told her—perhaps the quiet blue shadow of Windward Mountain creeping slowly over the pasture toward her, perhaps the silent glory of the great red-and-gold tree, perhaps the singing murmur of the little brook—perhaps all of them together had told her that now had come a time when she must do more than what Cousin Ann would do—when she must do what she herself knew was right. And that was to protect Aunt Frances from hurt.When she spoke, out there in the orchard, she broke the spell of silence. Cousin Ann climbed hastily down from her tree, with her basket only partly filled. Uncle Henry got stiffly off his ladder, and Aunt Abigail advanced through the grass. And they all said the same thing—""Let me see that letter.""They read it there, looking over each other's shoulders, with grave faces. Then, still silently, they all turned and went back into the house, leaving their forgotten bags and barrels and baskets out under the trees. When they found themselves in the kitchen—""Well, it's suppertime, anyhow,"" said Cousin Ann hastily, as if ashamed of losing her composure, ""or almost time. We might as well get it now.""""I'm a-going out to milk,"" said Uncle Henry gruffly, although it was not nearly his usual time. He took up the milk pails and marched out toward the barn, stepping heavily, his head hanging.Shep woke up with a snort and, getting off the couch, gamboled clumsily up to Betsy, wagging his tail and jumping up on her, ready for a frolic. That was almost too much for Betsy! To think that after tomorrow she would never see Shep again—nor Eleanor! Nor the kittens! She choked as she bent over Shep and put her arms around his neck for a great hug. But she mustn't cry, she mustn't hurt Aunt Frances's feelings, or show that she wasn't glad to go back to her. That wouldn't be fair, after all Aunt Frances had done for her!",5347_11.jpg

693,2,693_2.jpg,"The contrast between the natural red of the baby’s complexion and its snowy finery was ludicrously suggestive of an over-dressed nigger, to begin with; but when, in the paroxysms of its cough, the tiny creature’s face passed by shades of plum-color to a bluish black, the result was appalling to behold.Mrs. Lake’s experienced ears were not slow to discover that the child had got whooping-cough, which the nurse confessed was the case.  She also apologized for bringing in the baby among Mrs. Lake’s children, saying that she had “thought of nothing but the poor little chirrub herself.”“Don’t name it, mum,” replied the windmiller’s wife.  “I always say if children be to have things, they’ll have ’em; and if not, why they won’t.”  A theory which seems to sum up the views of the majority of people in Mrs. Lake’s class of life upon the spread of disease.“I’m sure I don’t know what’s coming to my poor head,” the nurse continued: “I’ve not so much as told you who I am, ma’am.  I’m nurse at the Grange, ma’am, with Mr. Ammaby and Lady Louisa.  They’ve been in town, and her ladyship’s had the very best advice, and now we’ve come to the country for three months, but the dear child don’t seem a bit the better.  And we’ve been trying every thing, I’m sure.  For any thing I heard of I’ve tried, as well as what the doctor ordered, and rubbing it with some stuff Lady Louisa’s mamma insisted upon, too,—even to a frog put into the dear child’s mouth, and drawed back by its legs, that’s supposed to be a certain cure, but only frightened it into a fit I thought it never would have come out of, as well as fetching her ladyship all the way from her boudoir to know what was the matter—which I no more dared tell her than fly.”“Dear, dear!” said the miller’s wife; “have you tried goose-grease, mum?  ’Tis an excellent thing.”“Goose-grease, ma’am, and an excellent ointment from the bone-setter’s at the toll-bar, which the butler paid for out of his own pocket, knowing it to have done a world of good to his sister that had a bad leg, besides being a certain cure for coughs, and cancer, and consumption as well.  And then the doctor’s  on its little chest, night and morning, besides; but nothing don’t seem to do no good,” said the poor nurse.  “And so, ma’am,—her ladyship being gone to the town,—thinks I, I’ll take the dear child to the windmill.  For they do say,—where I came from, ma’am,—that if a miller, that’s the son of a miller, and the grandson of a miller, holds a child that’s got the whooping-cough in the hopper of the mill whilst the mill’s going, it cures them, however bad they be.”The reason of the nurse’s visit being now made known, Mrs. Lake called her husband, and explained to him what he was asked to do for “her ladyship’s baby.”  The miller scratched his head.",5601_2.jpg
693,3,693_3.jpg,"“Well done, Cheap John!” roared one.  “You’ve chose a beauty, you have,” cried another.  “She’s ’arf a ’ead taller, anyway,” added a third.  “Many happy returns of the day, Jack!” yelled a fourth.Jan was charmed, and again and again he drew Mrs. Lake’s attention to the fact that it really But the windmiller’s wife was staring at the bride.  Not merely because the bride is commonly considered the central figure of a wedding-party, but because her face seemed familiar to Mrs. Lake, and she could not remember where she had seen her.  Though she could remember nothing, the association seemed to be one of pain.  In vain she beat her brains.  Memory was an almost uncultivated quality with her, and, like the rest of her intellectual powers, had a nervous, skittish way of deserting her in need, as if from timidity.Mrs. Lake could sometimes remember things when she got into bed, but on this occasion her pillow did not assist her; and the windmiller snubbed her for making “such a caddle” about a woman’s face she might have seen anywhere or nowhere, for that matter; so she got no help from him.And it was not till after the Cheap Jack and his wife had left the neighborhood, that one night (she was in bed) it suddenly “came to her,” as she said, that the dwarf’s bride was the woman who had brought Jan to the mill, on the night of the great storm.",5601_3.jpg
694,0,694_0.jpg,"But William had slightly moved the strap with his foot, as he stood with a perfectly unmoved and vacant countenance beside the Dame, which made some delay; and as Mrs. Datchett bent lower on the right side of her chair, William began upon the left a “hum,” which, with a close imitation of the crowing of a cock, the grunting of a pig, and the braying of a donkey, formed his chief stock of accomplishments.“Drat the thing!  Where be un?” said the Dame, endangering her balance in the search.“B-z-z-z-z!” went William behind the chair; and he added, , to Jan, “She be as dunch as a bittle.”At last the Dame heard, and looked round.  “Be that a harnet, missus, do ’ee think?” said William, with a face as guileless as a babe’s.Dame Datchett rose in terror.  William bent to look beneath her chair for the hornet, and of course repeated his hum.  As the hornet could neither be found nor got rid of, the alarmed old lady broke up the school, and went to lay a trap of brown sugar outside the window for her enemy.  And so Jan escaped a beating.But this and the story of his first fight are digressions.  It yet remains to be told how he took to drawing pigs.Dame Datchett’s cottage was the last on one side of the street; but it did not face the street, but looked over the water-meadows, and the little river, and the bridge.",5601_4.jpg
694,1,694_1.jpg,"Jan drew the slate-pencil from his pocket without reply.  Mrs. Salter, who had been watching him with motherly eyes, pushed a small stool towards him, and he began to draw a scene such as he had been studying daily for months past,—pigs at the water-side.  He had made dozens of such sketches.  But the delight of the farmer knew no bounds.  He slapped his knees, he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and, as Jan put a very wicked eye into the face of the hindmost pig, he laughed merrily also.  He was not insensible of his own talents, and the stimulus of the farmer’s approbation gave vigor to his strokes.“Here, missus,” cried Master Salter; “get down our Etherd’s new slate, and give it to un; I’ll get another for he.  And there’s the sixpence, Jan; and if thee minds pigs as well as ’ee draas ’em, I don’t care how long ’ee minds mine.”The object of his visit being now accomplished, Jan took up his hat to depart, but an important omission struck him, and he turned to say, “What’ll ’ee give me for minding your pigs, Master Salter?”Master Salter was economical, and Jan was small, and anxious for the place.“A shilling a week,” said the farmer.“And his tea?” the missus gently suggested.“Well, I don’t mind,” said Master Salter.  “A shilling a week and thee tea.”Jan paused.  His predecessor had had eighteen pence for very imperfect services.  Jan meant to be beyond reproach, and felt himself worth quite as much.",5601_5.jpg
694,2,694_2.jpg,"“Well, it used to be,” said Master Swift, apologetically.  “But the poor beast can’t sit well on these, and I relish my meat better with a face on the other side of the table.  He found that too slippery at first, till I bought yon bit of a patchwork-cushion for him at a sale.”Rufus sighed, and Master Swift gave him a piece of bread, which, having smelt, he allowed to lie before him on the table till his master, laughing, rubbed the bread against the bacon, with which additional flavor Rufus seemed content, and ate his supper.“So you’ve come to the old schoolmaster, after all?” said Master Swift: “that’s right, my lad, that’s right.”“’Twas Abel sent me,” said Jan; “he said I was to take to my books.  So I come because Abel axed me.  For I be main fond of Abel.”“Abel was right,” said the old man.  “Take to learning, my lad.  Love your books,—friends that nobody can kill, or part ye from.”“I’d like to learn pieces like them you say,” said Jan.“So ye shall, so ye shall!” cried Master Swift.  “It’s a fine thing, is learning poetry.  It strengthens the memory, and cultivates the higher faculties.  Take some more bacon, my lad.”Which Jan did.  At that moment he was not reflecting on his doomed friend, the spotted pig.  Indeed, if we reflected about every thing, this present state of existence would become intolerable.",5601_6.jpg
694,3,694_3.jpg,"“I be making a picture, Miss,” said Jan, pointing it out.“Go on making it, please,” said Amabel; and she sat down and watched him.“Do you like this wood, Bogy?” she asked, softly, after a time.“I do, Miss,” said Jan.“Why don’t you sleep in it, then?  I wouldn’t sleep in a cellar, if I were you.”“I don’t sleep in a cellar, Miss.” you do,” said Amabel, nodding emphatically.Jan was at a loss how to express the full inaccuracy of Nurse’s statement in polite language, so he was silent; rapidly adding tint to tint from his heap of leaves, whilst the birds sang overhead, and Amabel sat with her two bundles watching him.",5601_7.jpg
695,0,695_2.jpg,"       With illustrations by Harrison Cady            Now this is the story about the doll family I liked and the doll family I       didn’t. When you read it you are to remember something I am going to tell       you. This is it: If you think dolls never do anything you don’t see them       do, you are very much mistaken. When people are not looking at them they       can do anything they choose. They can dance and sing and play on the piano       and have all sorts of fun. But they can only move about and talk when       people turn their backs and are not looking. If any one looks, they just       stop. Fairies know this and of course Fairies visit in all the dolls’       houses where the dolls are agreeable. They will not associate, though,       with dolls who are not nice. They never call or leave their cards at a       dolls’ house where the dolls are proud or bad tempered. They are very       particular. If you are conceited or ill-tempered yourself, you will never       know a fairy as long as you live.            Racketty-Packetty House was in a corner of Cynthia’s nursery. And it was       not in the best corner either. It was in the corner behind the door, and       that was not at all a fashionable neighborhood. Racketty-Packetty House       had been pushed there to be out of the way when Tidy Castle was brought       in, on Cynthia’s birthday. As soon as she saw Tidy Castle Cynthia did not       care for Racketty-Packetty House and indeed was quite ashamed of it. She       thought the corner behind the door quite good enough for such a shabby old       dolls’ house, when there was the beautiful big new one built like a castle       and furnished with the most elegant chairs and tables and carpets and       curtains and ornaments and pictures and beds and baths and lamps and       book-cases, and with a knocker on the front door, and a stable with a pony       cart in it at the back. The minute she saw it she called out:            “Oh! what a beautiful doll castle! What shall we do with that untidy old       Racketty-Packetty House now? It is too shabby and old-fashioned to stand       near it.”             In fact, that was the way in which the old dolls’ house got its name. It       had always been called, “The Dolls’ House,” before, but after that it was       pushed into the unfashionable neighborhood behind the door and ever       afterwards—when it was spoken of at all—it was just called       Racketty-Packetty House, and nothing else.

Of course Tidy Castle was grand, and Tidy Castle was new and had all the       modern improvements in it, and Racketty-Packetty House was as       old-fashioned as it could be. It had belonged to Cynthia’s Grandmamma and       had been made in the days when Queen Victoria was a little girl, and when       there were no electric lights even in Princesses’ dolls’ houses. Cynthia’s       Grandmamma had kept it very neat because she had been a good housekeeper       even when she was seven years old. But Cynthia was not a good housekeeper       and she did not re-cover the furniture when it got dingy, or re-paper the       walls, or mend the carpets and bedclothes, and she never thought of such a       thing as making new clothes for the doll family, so that of course their       early Victorian frocks and capes and bonnets grew in time to be too shabby       for words. You see, when Queen Victoria was a little girl, dolls wore       queer frocks and long pantalets and boy dolls wore funny frilled trousers       and coats which it would almost make you laugh to look at.            But the Racketty-Packetty House family had known better days. I and my       Fairies had known them when they were quite new and had been a birthday       present just as Tidy Castle was when Cynthia turned eight years old, and       there was as much fuss about them when their house arrived as Cynthia made       when she saw Tidy Castle.            Cynthia’s Grandmamma had danced about and clapped her hands with delight,       and she had scrambled down upon her knees and taken the dolls out one by       one and thought their clothes beautiful. And she had given each one of       them a grand name.            “This one shall be Amelia,” she said. “And this one is Charlotte, and this       is Victoria Leopoldina, and this one Aurelia Matilda, and this one       Leontine, and this one Clotilda, and these boys shall be Augustus and       Rowland and Vincent and Charles Edward Stuart.”             For a long time they led a very gay and fashionable life. They had parties       and balls and were presented at Court and went to Royal Christenings and       Weddings and were married themselves and had families and scarlet fever       and whooping cough and funerals and every luxury. But that was long, long       ago, and now all was changed. Their house had grown shabbier and shabbier,       and their clothes had grown simply awful; and Aurelia Matilda and Victoria       Leopoldina had been broken to bits and thrown into the dust-bin, and       Leontine—who had really been the beauty of the family—had been       dragged out on the hearth rug one night and had had nearly all her paint       licked off and a leg chewed up by a Newfoundland puppy, so that she was a       sight to behold. As for the boys; Rowland and Vincent had quite       disappeared, and Charlotte and Amelia always believed they had run away to       seek their fortunes, because things were in such a state at home. So the       only ones who were left were Clotilda and Amelia and Charlotte and poor       Leontine and Augustus and Charles Edward Stuart. Even they had their names       changed.     ",8574_1.jpg

So the       only ones who were left were Clotilda and Amelia and Charlotte and poor       Leontine and Augustus and Charles Edward Stuart. Even they had their names       changed.            After Leontine had had her paint licked off so that her head had white       bald spots on it and she had scarcely any features, a boy cousin of       Cynthia’s had put a bright red spot on each cheek and painted her a turned       up nose and round saucer blue eyes and a comical mouth. He and Cynthia had       called her, “Ridiklis” instead of Leontine, and she had been called that       ever since. All the dolls were jointed Dutch dolls, so it was easy to       paint any kind of features on them and stick out their arms and legs in       any way you liked, and Leontine did look funny after Cynthia’s cousin had       finished. She certainly was not a beauty but her turned up nose and her       round eyes and funny mouth always seemed to be laughing so she really was       the most good-natured looking creature you ever saw.            Charlotte and Amelia, Cynthia had called Meg and Peg, and Clotilda she       called Kilmanskeg, and Augustus she called Gustibus, and Charles Edward       Stuart was nothing but Peter Piper. So that was the end of their grand       names.            The truth was, they went through all sorts of things, and if they had not       been such a jolly lot of dolls they might have had fits and appendicitis       and died of grief. But not a bit of it. If you will believe it, they got       fun out of everything. They used to just scream with laughter over the new       names, and they laughed so much over them that they got quite fond of       them. When Meg’s pink silk flounces were torn she pinned them up and       didn’t mind in the least, and when Peg’s lace mantilla was played with by       a kitten and brought back to her in rags and tags, she just put a few       stitches in it and put it on again; and when Peter Piper lost almost the       whole leg of one of his trousers he just laughed and said it made it       easier for him to kick about and turn somersaults and he wished the other       leg would tear off too.            You never saw a family have such fun. They could make up stories and       pretend things and invent games out of nothing. And my Fairies were so       fond of them that I couldn’t keep them away from the dolls’ house. They       would go and have fun with Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Gustibus and       Peter Piper, even when I had work for them to do in Fairyland. But there,       I was so fond of that shabby disrespectable family myself that I never       would scold much about them, and I often went to see them. That is how I       know so much about them. They were so fond of each other and so       good-natured and always in such spirits that everybody who knew them was       fond of them. And it was really only Cynthia who didn’t know them and       thought them only a lot of old disreputable looking Dutch dolls—and       Dutch dolls were quite out of fashion. The truth was that Cynthia was not       a particularly nice little girl, and did not care much for anything unless       it was quite new. But the kitten who had torn the lace mantilla got to       know the family and simply loved them all, and the Newfoundland puppy was       so sorry about Leontine’s paint and her left leg, that he could never do       enough to make up. He wanted to marry Leontine as soon as he grew old       enough to wear a collar, but Leontine said she would never desert her       family; because now that she wasn’t the beauty any more she became the       useful one, and did all the kitchen work, and sat up and made poultices       and beef tea when any of the rest were ill. And the Newfoundland puppy saw       she was right, for the whole family simply adored Ridiklis and could not       possibly have done without her. Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg could have       married any minute if they had liked. There were two cock sparrows and a       gentleman mouse, who proposed to them over and over again. They all three       said they did not want fashionable wives but cheerful dispositions and a       happy, home. But Meg and Peg were like Ridiklis and could not bear to       leave their families—besides not wanting to live in nests, and hatch       eggs—and Kilmanskeg said she would die of a broken heart if she       could not be with Ridiklis, and Ridiklis did not like cheese and crumbs       and mousy things, so they could never live together in a mouse hole. But       neither the gentleman mouse nor the sparrows were offended because the       news was broken to them so sweetly and they went on visiting just as       before. Everything was as shabby and disrespectable and as gay and happy       as it could be until Tidy Castle was brought into the nursery and then the       whole family had rather a fright.

They       would go and have fun with Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Gustibus and       Peter Piper, even when I had work for them to do in Fairyland. But there,       I was so fond of that shabby disrespectable family myself that I never       would scold much about them, and I often went to see them. That is how I       know so much about them. They were so fond of each other and so       good-natured and always in such spirits that everybody who knew them was       fond of them. And it was really only Cynthia who didn’t know them and       thought them only a lot of old disreputable looking Dutch dolls—and       Dutch dolls were quite out of fashion. The truth was that Cynthia was not       a particularly nice little girl, and did not care much for anything unless       it was quite new. But the kitten who had torn the lace mantilla got to       know the family and simply loved them all, and the Newfoundland puppy was       so sorry about Leontine’s paint and her left leg, that he could never do       enough to make up. He wanted to marry Leontine as soon as he grew old       enough to wear a collar, but Leontine said she would never desert her       family; because now that she wasn’t the beauty any more she became the       useful one, and did all the kitchen work, and sat up and made poultices       and beef tea when any of the rest were ill. And the Newfoundland puppy saw       she was right, for the whole family simply adored Ridiklis and could not       possibly have done without her. Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg could have       married any minute if they had liked. There were two cock sparrows and a       gentleman mouse, who proposed to them over and over again. They all three       said they did not want fashionable wives but cheerful dispositions and a       happy, home. But Meg and Peg were like Ridiklis and could not bear to       leave their families—besides not wanting to live in nests, and hatch       eggs—and Kilmanskeg said she would die of a broken heart if she       could not be with Ridiklis, and Ridiklis did not like cheese and crumbs       and mousy things, so they could never live together in a mouse hole. But       neither the gentleman mouse nor the sparrows were offended because the       news was broken to them so sweetly and they went on visiting just as       before. Everything was as shabby and disrespectable and as gay and happy       as it could be until Tidy Castle was brought into the nursery and then the       whole family had rather a fright.            It happened in this way:            When the dolls’ house was lifted by the nurse and carried into the corner       behind the door, of course it was rather an exciting and shaky thing for       Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Gustibus and Peter Piper (Ridiklis was out       shopping). The furniture tumbled about and everybody had to hold on to       anything they could catch hold of. As it was, Kilmanskeg slid under a       table and Peter Piper sat down in the coal-box; but notwithstanding all       this, they did not lose their tempers and when the nurse sat their house       down on the floor with a bump, they all got up and began to laugh. Then       they ran and peeped out of the windows and then they ran back and laughed       again.     ",8574_3.jpg

Then       they ran and peeped out of the windows and then they ran back and laughed       again.            “Well,” said Peter Piper, “we have been called Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg       and Gustibus and Peter Piper instead of our grand names, and now we live       in a place called Racketty-Packetty House. Who cares! Let’s join hands and       have a dance.”             And they joined hands and danced round and round and kicked up their       heels, and their rags and tatters flew about and they laughed until they       fell down; one on top of the other.            It was just at this minute that Ridiklis came back. The nurse had found       her under a chair and stuck her in through a window. She sat on the       drawing-room sofa which had holes in its covering and the stuffing coming       out, and her one whole leg stuck out straight in front of her, and her       bonnet and shawl were on one side and her basket was on her left arm full       of things she had got cheap at market. She was out of breath and rather       pale through being lifted up and swished through the air so suddenly, but       her saucer eyes and her funny mouth looked as cheerful as ever.            “Good gracious, if you knew what I have just heard!” she said. They all       scrambled up and called out together.            “Hello! What is it?”             “The nurse said the most awful thing,” she answered them. “When Cynthia       asked what she should do with this old Racketty-Packetty House, she said,       ‘Oh! I’ll put it behind the door for the present and then it shall be       carried down-stairs and burned. It’s too disgraceful to be kept in any       decent nursery.’”             “Oh!” cried out Peter Piper.            “Oh! Oh! Oh!” said Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg. “Will they burn our dear       old shabby house? Do you think they will?” And actually tears began to run       down their cheeks.     ",8574_4.jpg
696,1,696_1.jpg,"       “I don’t care how shabby it is,” he said. “It’s a jolly nice old place and       it’s the only house we’ve ever had.”             “I never want to have any other,” said Meg.            Gustibus leaned against the wall with his hands stuffed in his pockets.            “I wouldn’t move if I was made King of England,” he said. “Buckingham       Palace wouldn’t be half as nice.”             “We’ve had such fun here,” said Peg. And Kilmanskeg shook her head from       side to side and wiped her eyes on her ragged pocket-handkerchief. There       is no knowing what would have happened to them if Peter Piper hadn’t       cheered up as he always did.            “I say,” he said, “do you hear that noise?” They all listened and heard a       rumbling. Peter Piper ran to the window and looked out and then ran back       grinning.            “It’s the nurse rolling up the arm-chair before the house to hide it, so       that it won’t disgrace the castle. Hooray! Hooray! If they don’t see us       they will forget all about us and we shall not be burned up at all. Our       nice old Racketty-Packetty House will be left alone and we can enjoy       ourselves more than ever—because we sha’n’t be bothered with Cynthia—Hello!       let’s all join hands and have a dance.”             So they all joined hands and danced round in a ring again and they were so       relieved that they laughed and laughed until they all tumbled down in a       heap just as they had done before, and rolled about giggling and       squealing. It certainly seemed as if they were quite safe for some time at       least. The big easy chair hid them and both the nurse and Cynthia seemed       to forget that there was such a thing as a Racketty-Packetty House in the       neighborhood. Cynthia was so delighted with Tidy Castle that she played       with nothing else for days and days. And instead of being jealous of their       grand neighbors the Racketty-Packetty House people began to get all sorts       of fun out of watching them from their own windows. Several of their       windows were broken and some had rags and paper stuffed into the broken       panes, but Meg and Peg and Peter Piper would go and peep out of one, and       Gustibus and Kilmanskeg would peep out of another, and Ridiklis could       scarcely get her dishes washed and her potatoes pared because she could       see the Castle kitchen from her scullery window. It was        The Castle dolls were grand beyond words, and they were all lords and       ladies. These were their names. There was Lady Gwendolen Vere de Vere. She       was haughty and had dark eyes and hair and carried her head thrown back       and her nose in the air. There was Lady Muriel Vere de Vere, and she was       cold and lovely and indifferent and looked down the bridge of her delicate       nose. And there was Lady Doris, who had fluffy golden hair and laughed       mockingly at everybody. And there was Lord Hubert and Lord Rupert and Lord       Francis, who were all handsome enough to make you feel as if you could       faint. And there was their mother, the Duchess of Tidyshire; and of course       there were all sorts of maids and footmen and cooks and scullery maids and       even gardeners.            “We never thought of living to see such grand society,” said Peter Piper       to his brother and sisters. “It’s quite a kind of blessing.”             “It’s almost like being grand ourselves, just to be able to watch them,”        said Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg, squeezing together and flattening their       noses against the attic windows.            They could see bits of the sumptuous white and gold drawing-room with the       Duchess sitting reading near the fire, her golden glasses upon her nose,       and Lady Gwendolen playing haughtily upon the harp, and Lady Muriel coldly       listening to her. Lady Doris was having her golden hair dressed by her       maid in her bed-room and Lord Hubert was reading the newspaper with a       high-bred air, while Lord Francis was writing letters to noblemen of his       acquaintance, and Lord Rupert was—in an aristocratic manner—glancing       over his love letters from ladies of title.

Kilmanskeg and Peter Piper just pinched each other with glee and squealed       with delight.            “Isn’t it fun,” said Peter Piper. “I say; aren’t they awful swells! But       Lord Francis can’t kick about in his trousers as I can in mine, and       neither can the others. I’ll like to see them try to do this,”— and       he turned three summersaults in the middle of the room and stood on his       head on the biggest hole in the carpet—and wiggled his legs and       wiggled his toes at them until they shouted so with laughing that Ridiklis       ran in with a saucepan in her hand and perspiration on her forehead,       because she was cooking turnips, which was all they had for dinner.            “You mustn’t laugh so loud,” she cried out. “If we make so much noise the       Tidy Castle people will begin to complain of this being a low neighborhood       and they might insist on moving away.”             “Oh! scrump!” said Peter Piper, who sometimes invented doll slang—       though there wasn’t really a bit of harm in him. “I wouldn’t have them       move away for anything. They are meat and drink to me.”             “They are going to have a dinner of ten courses,” sighed Ridiklis, “I can       see them cooking it from my scullery window. And I have nothing but       turnips to give you.”             “Who cares!” said Peter Piper, “Let’s have ten courses of turnips and       pretend each course is exactly like the one they are having at the       Castle.”             “I like turnips almost better than anything—almost—perhaps not       quite,” said Gustibus. “I can eat ten courses of turnips like a shot.”             “Let’s go and find out what their courses are,” said Meg and Peg and       Kilmanskeg, “and then we will write a menu on a piece of pink tissue       paper.”      ",8574_6.jpg

They divided their       turnips into ten courses and they called the first one—“Hors       d’oeuvres,” and the last one “Ices,” with a French name, and Peter Piper       kept jumping up from the table and pretending he was a footman and       flourishing about in his flapping rags of trousers and announcing the       names of the dishes in such a grand way that they laughed till they nearly       died, and said they never had had such a splendid dinner in their lives,       and that they would rather live behind the door and watch the Tidy Castle       people than be the Tidy Castle people themselves.            And then of course they all joined hands and danced round and round and       kicked up their heels for joy, because they always did that whenever there       was the least excuse for it—and quite often when there wasn’t any at       all, just because it was such good exercise and worked off their high       spirits so that they could settle down for a while.            This was the way things went on day after day. They almost lived at their       windows. They watched the Tidy Castle family get up and be dressed by       their maids and valets in different clothes almost every day. They saw       them drive out in their carriages, and have parties, and go to balls. They       all nearly had brain fever with delight the day they watched Lady       Gwendolen and Lady Muriel and Lady Doris, dressed in their Court trains       and feathers, going to be presented at the first Drawing-Room.            After the lovely creatures had gone the whole family sat down in a circle       round the Racketty-Packetty House library fire, and Ridiklis read aloud to       them about Drawing-Rooms, out of a scrap of the Lady’s Pictorial she had       found, and after that they had a Court Drawing-Room of their own, and they       made tissue-paper trains and glass bead crowns for diamond tiaras, and       sometimes Gustibus pretended to be the Royal family, and the others were       presented to him and kissed his hand, and then the others took turns and       he was presented. And suddenly the most delightful thing occurred to Peter       Piper. He thought it would be rather nice to make them all into lords and       ladies and he did it by touching them on the shoulder with the       drawing-room poker which he straightened because it was so crooked that it       was almost bent double. It is not exactly the way such things are done at       Court, but Peter Piper thought it would do— and at any rate it was       great fun. So he made them all kneel down in a row and he touched each on       the shoulder with the poker and said:            “Rise up, Lady Meg and Lady Peg and Lady Kilmanskeg and Lady Ridiklis of       Racketty-Packetty House-and also the Right Honorable Lord Gustibus Rags!”        And they all jumped up at once and made bows and curtsied to each other.       But they made Peter Piper into a Duke, and he was called the Duke of Tags.       He knelt down on the big hole in the carpet and each one of them gave him       a little thump on the shoulder with the poker, because it took more thumps       to make a Duke than a common or garden Lord.

The day after this another much more exciting thing took place. The nurse       was in a bad temper and when she was tidying the nursery she pushed the       easy chair aside and saw Racketty-Packetty House.            “Oh!” she said, “there is that Racketty-Packetty old thing still. I had       forgotten it. It must be carried down-stairs and burned. I will go and       tell one of the footmen to come for it.”             Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg were in their attic and they all rushed out in       such a hurry to get down-stairs that they rolled all the way down the       staircase, and Peter Piper and Gustibus had to dart out of the       drawing-room and pick them up, Ridiklis came staggering up from the       kitchen quite out of breath.            “Oh! our house is going to be burned! Our house is going to be burned!”        cried Meg and Peg clutching their brothers.            “Let us go and throw ourselves out of the window!” cried Kilmanskeg.            “I don’t see how they can have the heart to burn a person’s home!” said       Ridiklis, wiping her eyes with her kitchen duster.            Peter Piper was rather pale, but he was extremely brave and remembered       that he was the head of the family.            “Now, Lady Meg and Lady Peg and Lady Kilmanskeg,” he said, “let us all       keep cool.”      ",8574_8.jpg

Peter Piper was rather pale, but he was extremely brave and remembered       that he was the head of the family.            “Now, Lady Meg and Lady Peg and Lady Kilmanskeg,” he said, “let us all       keep cool.”             “We shan’t keep cool when they set our house on fire,” said Gustibus.       Peter Piper just snapped his fingers.            “Pooh!” he said. “We are only made of wood and it won’t hurt a bit. We       shall just snap and crackle and go off almost like fireworks and then we       shall be ashes and fly away into the air and see all sorts of things.       Perhaps it may be more fun than anything we have done yet.”             “But our nice old house! Our nice old Racketty-Packetty House,” said       Ridiklis. “I do so love it. The kitchen is so convenient—even though       the oven won’t bake any more.”             And things looked most serious because the nurse really was beginning to       push the arm-chair away. But it would not move and I will tell you why.       One of my Fairies, who had come down the chimney when they were talking,       had called me and I had come in a second with a whole army of my Workers,       and though the nurse couldn’t see them, they were all holding the chair       tight down on the carpet so that it would not stir.            And I—Queen Crosspatch—myself—flew downstairs and made       the footman remember that minute that a box had come for Cynthia and that       he must take it upstairs to her nursery. If I had not been on the spot he       would have forgotten it until it was too late. But just in the very nick       of time up he came, and Cynthia sprang up as soon as she saw him.            “Oh!” she cried out, “It must be the doll who broke her little leg and was       sent to the hospital. It must be Lady Patsy.”             And she opened the box and gave a little scream of joy for there lay Lady       Patsy (her whole name was Patricia) in a lace-frilled nightgown, with her       lovely leg in bandages and a pair of tiny crutches and a trained nurse by       her side.            That was how I saved them that time. There was such excitement over Lady       Patsy and her little crutches and her nurse that nothing else was thought       of and my Fairies pushed the arm-chair back and Racketty-Packetty House       was hidden and forgotten once more.            The whole Racketty-Packetty family gave a great gasp of joy and sat down       in a ring all at once, on the floor, mopping their foreheads with anything       they could get hold of. Peter Piper used an antimacassar.            “Oh! we are obliged to you, Queen B-bell—Patch,” he panted out, “But       these alarms of fire are upsetting.”             “You leave them to me,” I said, “and I’ll attend to them. Tip!” I       commanded the Fairy nearest me. “You will have to stay about here and be       ready to give the alarm when anything threatens to happen.” And I flew       away, feeling I had done a good morning’s work.            Well, that was the beginning of a great many things, and many of them were       connected with Lady Patsy; and but for me there might have been       unpleasantness.            Of course the Racketty-Packetty dolls forgot about their fright directly,       and began to enjoy themselves again as usual. That was their way. They       never sat up all night with Trouble, Peter Piper used to say. And I told       him they were quite right. If you make a fuss over trouble and put it to       bed and nurse it and give it beef tea and gruel, you can never get rid of       it.     ",8574_9.jpg

If you make a fuss over trouble and put it to       bed and nurse it and give it beef tea and gruel, you can never get rid of       it.            Their great delight now was Lady Patsy. They thought she was prettier than       any of the other Tidy Castle dolls. She neither turned her nose up, nor       looked down the bridge of it, nor laughed mockingly. She had dimples in       the corners of her mouth and long curly lashes and her nose was saucy and       her eyes were bright and full of laughs.            “She’s the clever one of the family,” said Peter Piper. “I am sure of       that.”             She was treated as an invalid at first, of course, and kept in her room;       but they could see her sitting up in her frilled nightgown. After a few       days she was carried to a soft chair lay the window and there she used to       sit and look out; and the Racketty-Packetty House dolls crowded round       their window and adored her.            After a few days, they noticed that Peter Piper was often missing and one       morning Ridiklis went up into the attic and found him sitting at a window       all by himself and staring and staring.            “Oh! Duke,” she said (you see they always tried to remember each other’s       titles). “Dear me, Duke, what are you doing here?”             “I am looking at her,” he answered. “I’m in love. I fell in love with her       the minute Cynthia took her out of her box. I am going to marry her.”             “But she’s a lady of high degree,” said Ridiklis quite alarmed.            “That’s why she’ll have me,” said Peter Piper in his most cheerful manner.       “Ladies of high degree always marry the good looking ones in rags and       tatters. If I had a whole suit of clothes on, she wouldn’t look at me. I’m       very good-looking, you know,” and he turned round and winked at Ridiklis       in such a delightful saucy way that she suddenly felt as if he        very good-looking, though she had not thought of it before.     ",8574_10.jpg
697,3,697_3.jpg,"       “That’s why she’ll have me,” said Peter Piper in his most cheerful manner.       “Ladies of high degree always marry the good looking ones in rags and       tatters. If I had a whole suit of clothes on, she wouldn’t look at me. I’m       very good-looking, you know,” and he turned round and winked at Ridiklis       in such a delightful saucy way that she suddenly felt as if he        very good-looking, though she had not thought of it before.            “Hello,” he said all at once. “I’ve just thought of something to attract       her attention. Where’s the ball of string?”             Cynthia’s kitten had made them a present of a ball of string which had       been most useful. Ridiklis ran and got it, and all the others came running       upstairs to see what Peter Piper was going to do. They all were delighted       to hear he had fallen in love with the lovely, funny Lady Patsy. They       found him standing in the middle of the attic unrolling the ball of       string.            “What are you going to do, Duke?” they all shouted.            “Just you watch,” he said, and he began to make the string into a rope       ladder—as fast as lightning. When he had finished it, he fastened       one end of it to a beam and swung the other end out of the window.            “From her window,” he said, “she can see Racketty-Packetty House and I’ll       tell you something. She’s always looking at it. She watches us as much as       we watch her, and I have seen her giggling and giggling when we were       having fun. Yesterday when I chased Lady Meg and Lady Peg and Lady       Kilmanskeg round and round the front of the house and turned summersaults       every five steps, she laughed until she had to stuff her handkerchief into       her mouth. When we joined hands and danced and laughed until we fell in       heaps I thought she was going to have a kind of rosy-dimpled, lovely       little fit, she giggled so. If I run down the side of the house on this       rope ladder it will attract her attention and then I shall begin to do       things.”             He ran down the ladder and that very minute they saw Lady Patsy at her       window give a start and lean forward to look. They all crowded round their       window and chuckled and chuckled as they watched him.            He turned three stately summersaults and stood on his feet and made a       cheerful bow. The Racketty-Packettys saw Lady Patsy begin to giggle that       minute. Then he took an antimacassar out of his pocket and fastened it       round the edge of his torn trousers leg, as if it were lace trimming and       began to walk about like a Duke—with his arms folded on his chest       and his ragged old hat cocked on one side over his ear. Then the       Racketty-Packettys saw Lady Patsy begin to laugh. Then Peter Piper stood       on his head and kissed his hand and Lady Patsy covered her face and rocked       backwards and forwards in her chair laughing and laughing.            Then he struck an attitude with his tattered leg put forward gracefully       and he pretended he had a guitar and he sang right up at her window.            “From Racketty-Packetty House I come, It stands, dear Lady, in a slum, A       low, low slum behind the door The stout arm-chair is placed before, (Just       take a look at it, my Lady).            “The house itself is a perfect sight, And everybody’s dressed like a       perfect fright, But no one cares a single jot And each one giggles over       his lot, (And as for me, I’m in love with you).            “I can’t make up another verse, And if I did it would be worse, But I       could stand and sing all day, If I could think of things to say, (But the       fact is I just wanted to make you look at me).”             And then he danced such a lively jig that his rags and tags flew about       him, and then he made another bow and kissed his hand again and ran up the       ladder like a flash and jumped into the attic.            After that Lady Patsy sat at her window all the time and would not let the       trained nurse put her to bed at all; and Lady Gwendolen and Lady Muriel       and Lady Doris could not understand it. Once Lady Gwendolen said haughtily       and disdainfully and scornfully and scathingly:            “If you sit there so much, those low Racketty-Packetty House people will       think you are looking at them.”      ",8574_11.jpg
698,0,698_0.jpg,"       When the castle dolls drove out or walked in their garden, the instant       they caught sight of one of the Racketty-Packettys they turned up their       noses and sniffed aloud, and several times the Duchess said she would       remove because the neighborhood was absolutely low. They all scorned the       Racketty-Packettys—they just        One moonlight night Lady Patsy was sitting at her window and she heard a       whistle in the garden. When she peeped out carefully, there stood Peter       Piper waving his ragged cap at her, and he had his rope ladder under his       arm.            “Hello,” he whispered as loud as he could. “Could you catch a bit of rope       if I threw it up to you?”             “Yes,” she whispered back.            “Then catch this,” he whispered again and he threw up the end of a string       and she caught it the first throw. It was fastened to the rope ladder.            “Now pull,” he said.            She pulled and pulled until the rope ladder reached her window and then       she fastened that to a hook under the sill and the first thing that       happened—just like lightning—was that Peter Piper ran up the       ladder and leaned over her window ledge.            “Will you marry me,” he said. “I haven’t anything to give you to eat and I       am as ragged as a scarecrow, but will you?”             She clapped her little hands.            “I eat very little,” she said. “And I would do without anything at all, if       I could live in your funny old shabby house.”             “It is a ridiculous, tumbled-down old barn, isn’t it?” he said. “But every       one of us is as nice as we can be. We are perfect Turkish Delights. It’s       laughing that does it. Would you like to come down the ladder and see what       a jolly, shabby old hole the place is?”             “Oh! do take me,” said Lady Patsy.            So he helped her down the ladder and took her under the armchair and into       Racketty-Packetty House and Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Ridiklis and       Gustibus all crowded round her and gave little screams of joy at the sight       of her.            They were afraid to kiss her at first, even though she was engaged to       Peter Piper. She was so pretty and her frock had so much lace on it that       they were afraid their old rags might spoil her. But she did not care       about her lace and flew at them and kissed and hugged them every one.            “I have so wanted to come here,” she said. “It’s so dull at the Castle I       had to break my leg just to get a change. The Duchess sits reading near       the fire with her gold eye-glasses on her nose and Lady Gwendolen plays       haughtily on the harp and Lady Muriel coldly listens to her, and Lady       Doris is always laughing mockingly, and Lord Hubert reads the newspaper       with a high-bred air, and Lord Francis writes letters to noblemen of his       acquaintance, and Lord Rupert glances over his love letters from ladies of       title, in an aristocratic manner—until I could . Just       to see you dears dancing about in your rags and tags and laughing and       inventing games as if you didn’t mind anything, is such a relief.”      ",8574_12.jpg

Just       to see you dears dancing about in your rags and tags and laughing and       inventing games as if you didn’t mind anything, is such a relief.”             She nearly laughed her little curly head off when they all went round the       house with her, and Peter Piper showed her the holes in the carpet and the       stuffing coming out of the sofas, and the feathers out of the beds, and       the legs tumbling off the chairs. She had never seen anything like it       before.            “At the Castle, nothing is funny at all,” she said. “And nothing ever       sticks out or hangs down or tumbles off. It is so plain and new.”             “But I think we ought to tell her, Duke,” Ridiklis said. “We may have our       house burned over our heads any day.” She really stopped laughing for a       whole minute when she heard that, but she was rather like Peter Piper in       disposition and she said almost immediately.            “Oh! they’ll never do it. They’ve forgotten you.” And Peter Piper said:            “Don’t let’s think of it. Let’s all join hands and dance round and round       and kick up our heels and laugh as hard as ever we can.”             And they did—and Lady Patsy laughed harder than any one else. After       that she was always stealing away from Tidy Castle and coming in and       having fun. Sometimes she stayed all night and slept with Meg and Peg and       everybody invented new games and stories and they really never went to bed       until daylight. But the Castle dolls grew more and more scornful every       day, and tossed their heads higher and higher and sniffed louder and       louder until it sounded as if they all had influenza. They never lost an       opportunity of saying disdainful things and once the Duchess wrote a       letter to Cynthia, saying that she insisted on removing to a decent       neighborhood. She laid the letter in her desk but the gentleman mouse came       in the night and carried it away. So Cynthia never saw it and I don’t       believe she could have read it if she had seen it because the Duchess       wrote very badly—even for a doll.            And then what do you suppose happened? One morning Cynthia began to play       that all the Tidy Castle dolls had scarlet fever. She said it had broken       out in the night and she undressed them all and put them into bed and gave       them medicine. She could not find Lady Patsy, so  escaped the       contagion. The truth was that Lady Patsy had stayed all night at       Racketty-Packetty House, where they were giving an imitation Court Ball       with Peter Piper in a tin crown, and shavings for supper—because       they had nothing else, and in fact the gentleman mouse had brought the       shavings from his nest as a present.

They were all over at Tidy Castle in a minute. They just tumbled over each       other to get there—the kind-hearted things. The servants were every       one fast asleep, though the noise was awful.

She sent Gustibus to waken the servants and then ordered hot water and       cold water, and ice, and brandy, and poultices, and shook the trained       nurse for not attending to her business—and took off the mustard       plasters and gave gruel and broth and cough syrup and castor oil and       ipecacuanha, and everyone of the Racketty-Packettys massaged, and soothed,       and patted, and put wet cloths on heads, until the fever was gone and the       Castle dolls all lay back on their pillows pale and weak, but smiling       faintly at every Racketty-Packetty they saw, instead of turning up their       noses and tossing their heads and sniffing loudly, and just        Lady Gwendolen spoke first and instead of being haughty and disdainful,       she was as humble as a new-born kitten.

She sent Gustibus to waken the servants and then ordered hot water and       cold water, and ice, and brandy, and poultices, and shook the trained       nurse for not attending to her business—and took off the mustard       plasters and gave gruel and broth and cough syrup and castor oil and       ipecacuanha, and everyone of the Racketty-Packettys massaged, and soothed,       and patted, and put wet cloths on heads, until the fever was gone and the       Castle dolls all lay back on their pillows pale and weak, but smiling       faintly at every Racketty-Packetty they saw, instead of turning up their       noses and tossing their heads and sniffing loudly, and just        Lady Gwendolen spoke first and instead of being haughty and disdainful,       she was as humble as a new-born kitten.            “Oh! you dear, shabby, disrespectable, darling things!” she said. “Never,       never, will I scorn you again. Never, never!”             “That’s right!” said Peter Piper in his cheerful, rather slangy way. “You       take my tip-never you scorn any one again. It’s a mistake. Just you watch       me stand on my head. It’ll cheer you up.”             And he turned six summersaults—just like lightning—and stood       on his head and wiggled his ragged legs at them until suddenly they heard       a snort from one of the beds and it was Lord Hubert beginning to laugh and       then Lord Francis laughed and then Lord Hubert shouted, and then Lady       Doris squealed, and Lady Muriel screamed, and Lady Gwendolen and the       Duchess rolled over and over in their beds, laughing as if they would have       fits.            “Oh! you delightful, funny, shabby old loves!” Lady Gwendolen kept saying.       “To think that we scorned you.”             “They’ll be all right after this,” said Peter Piper. “There’s nothing       cures scarlet fever like cheering up. Let’s all join hands and dance round       and round once for them before we go back to bed. It’ll throw them into a       nice light perspiration and they’ll drop off and sleep like tops.” And       they did it, and before they had finished, the whole lot of them were       perspiring gently and snoring as softly as lambs.            When they went back to Racketty-Packetty House they talked a good deal       about Cynthia and wondered and wondered why she had left her scarlet fever       so suddenly. And at last Ridiklis made up her mind to tell them something       she had heard.            “The Duchess told me,” she said, rather slowly because it was bad news—“The       Duchess said that Cynthia went away because her Mama had sent for her—and       her Mama had sent for her to tell her that a little girl princess is       coming to see her to-morrow. Cynthia’s Mama used to be a maid of honor to       the Queen and that’s why the little girl Princess is coming. The Duchess       said—” and here Ridiklis spoke very slowly indeed, “that the nurse       was so excited she said she did not know whether she stood on her head or       her heels, and she must tidy up the nursery and have that       Racketty-Packetty old dolls’ house carried down stairs and burned, early       to-morrow morning. That’s what the Duchess        Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg clutched at their hearts and gasped and       Gustibus groaned and Lady Patsy caught Peter Piper by the arm to keep from       falling. Peter Piper gulped—and then he had a sudden cheerful       thought.            “Perhaps she was raving in delirium,” he said.     ",8574_16.jpg

She was as sensible as any of us.       To-morrow morning we shall not have a house over our heads,” and she put       her ragged old apron over her face and cried.            “If she wasn’t raving in delirium,” said Peter Piper, “we shall not have       any heads. You had better go back to the Castle tonight, Patsy.       Racketty-Packetty House is no place for you.”             Then Lady Patsy drew herself up so straight that she nearly fell over       backwards.     —leave you!” she said, and Peter       Piper couldn’t make her.            You can just imagine what a doleful night it was. They went all over the       house together and looked at every hole in the carpet and every piece of       stuffing sticking out of the dear old shabby sofas, and every broken       window and chair leg and table and ragged blanket— and the tears ran       down their faces for the first time in their lives. About six o’clock in       the morning Peter Piper made a last effort.     ",8574_17.jpg
699,2,699_2.jpg,"       “If she wasn’t raving in delirium,” said Peter Piper, “we shall not have       any heads. You had better go back to the Castle tonight, Patsy.       Racketty-Packetty House is no place for you.”             Then Lady Patsy drew herself up so straight that she nearly fell over       backwards.     —leave you!” she said, and Peter       Piper couldn’t make her.

They went all over the       house together and looked at every hole in the carpet and every piece of       stuffing sticking out of the dear old shabby sofas, and every broken       window and chair leg and table and ragged blanket— and the tears ran       down their faces for the first time in their lives. About six o’clock in       the morning Peter Piper made a last effort.            “Let’s all join hands in a circle,” he said quite faintly, “and dance       round and round once more.”             But it was no use. When they joined hands they could not dance, and when       they found they could not dance they all tumbled down in a heap and cried       instead of laughing and Lady Patsy lay with her arms round Peter Piper’s       neck.            Now here is where I come in again—Queen Crosspatch—who is       telling you this story. I always come in just at the nick of time when       people like the Racketty-Packettys are in trouble. I walked in at seven       o’clock.            “Get up off the floor,” I said to them all and they got up and stared at       me. They actually thought I did not know what had happened.            “A little girl Princess is coming this morning,” said Peter Piper, and our       house is going to be burned over our heads. This is the end of       Racketty-Packetty House.”             “No, it isn’t!” I said. “You leave this to me. I told the Princess to come       here, though she doesn’t know it in the least.”             A whole army of my Working Fairies began to swarm in at the nursery       window. The nurse was working very hard to put things in order and she had       not sense enough to see Fairies at all. So she did not see mine, though       there were hundreds of them. As soon as she made one corner tidy, they ran       after her and made it untidy. They held her back by her dress and hung and       swung on her apron until she could scarcely move and kept wondering why       she was so slow. She could not make the nursery tidy and she was so       flurried she forgot all about Racketty-Packetty House again—especially       as my Working Fairies pushed the arm-chair close up to it so that it was       quite hidden. And there it was when the little girl Princess came with her       Ladies in Waiting. My fairies had only just allowed the nurse to finish       the nursery.            Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Ridiklis and Gustibus and Peter Piper and       Lady Patsy were huddled up together looking out of one window. They could       not bear to be parted. I sat on the arm of the big chair and ordered my       Working Fairies to stand ready to obey me the instant I spoke.     ",8574_18.jpg
699,3,699_3.jpg,"       “If it were mine I should make it just like Grandmamma’s and I should love       it more than any doll’s house I have. I never—never— never—saw       anything as nice and laughing and good natured as these dolls’ faces. They       look as if they had been having fun ever since they were born. Oh! if you       were to burn them and their home I—I could never forgive you!”             “I never—never—will,—your Highness,” stammered Cynthia,       quite overwhelmed. Suddenly she started forward.            “Why, there is the lost doll!” she cried out. “There is Lady Patsy. How       did she get into Racketty-Packetty House?”             “Perhaps she went there to see them because they were so poor and shabby,”        said the little girl Princess. “Perhaps she likes this one,” and she       pointed to Peter Piper. “Do you know when I picked him up their arms were       about each other. Please let her stay with him. Oh!” she cried out the       next instant and jumped a little. “I felt as if the boy one kicked his       leg.”             And it was actually true, because Peter Piper could not help it and he had       kicked out his ragged leg for joy. He had to be very careful not to kick       any more when he heard what happened next.            As the Princess liked Racketty-Packetty House so much, Cynthia gave it to       her for a present—and the Princess was really happy—and before       she went away she made a little speech to the whole Racketty-Packetty       family, whom she had set all in a row in the ragged old, dear old, shabby       old drawing-room where they had had so much fun.            “You are going to come and live with me, funny, good-natured loves,” she       said. “And you shall all be dressed beautifully again and your house shall       be mended and papered and painted and made as lovely as ever it was. And I       am going to like you better than all my other dolls’ houses—just as       Grandmamma said she liked hers.” And then she was gone.            And every bit of it came true. Racketty-Packetty House was carried to a       splendid Nursery in a Palace, and Meg and Peg and Kilmanskeg and Ridiklis       and Gustibus and Peter Piper were made so gorgeous that if they had not       been so nice they would have grown proud. But they didn’t. They only grew       jollier and jollier and Peter Piper married Lady Patsy, and Ridiklis’s       left leg was mended and she was painted into a beauty again—but she       always remained the useful one. And the dolls in the other dolls’ houses       used to make deep curtsies when a Racketty-Packetty House doll passed       them, and Peter Piper could scarcely stand it because it always made him       want to stand on his head and laugh—and so when they were curtsied       at— because they were related to the Royal Dolls House—they       used to run into their drawing room and fall into fits of giggles and they       could only stop them by all joining hands together in a ring and dancing       round and round and round and kicking up their heels and laughing until       they tumbled down in a heap.            And what do you think of that for a story. And doesn’t it prove to you       what a valuable Friend a Fairy is—particularly a Queen one?

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       http://www.gutenberg.net  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
